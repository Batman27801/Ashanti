crisp and clear
we are never to say huh
aint or yall
git or gonna
never maamjust yes with eyes
meeting eyes enough
to show respect
dont ever maam anyone
the word too painful
a memory for my mother
of not so long ago
southern subservient days   

the list of what not to say
goes on and on   

you are from the north our mother says
you know the right way to speak

as the switch raises dark welts on my brothers legs
dell and i look on
afraid to open our mouths fearing the south
will slip out or
into them
even though the laws have changed
my grandmother still takes us
to the back of the bus when we go downtown
in the rain its easier my grandmother says
than having white folks look at me like im dirt

but we arent dirt we are people
paying the same fare as other people
when i say this to my grandmother 
she nods says easier to stay where you belong

i look around and see the ones
who walk straight to the back see
the ones who take a seat up front daring
anyone to make them move and know
this is who i want to be not scared
like that brave
like that

still my grandmother takes my hand downtown
pulls me right past the restaurants that have to let us sit
wherever we want now no need in making trouble
she says you all go back to new york city but
i have to live here

we walk straight past woolworths
without even looking in the windows
because the one time my grandmother went inside
they made her wait and wait acted like
i wasnt even there its hard not to see the moment
my grandmother in her sunday clothes a hat
with a flower pinned to it
neatly on her head her patent leather purse
perfectly clasped
between her gloved handswaiting quietly
long past her turn
now when i walk around at lunchtime
i have only two charms in my pocket
an old roman coin mike kanemitsu gave me
and a bolt head that broke off a packing case
when i was in madrid the others never
brought me too much luck though they did
help keep me in new york against coercion
but now im happy for a time and interested

i walk through the luminous humidity
passing the house of seagram with its wet
and its loungers and the construction to
the left that closed the sidewalk if
i ever get to be a construction worker
id like to have a silver hat please
and get to moriartys where i wait for
leroi and hear who wants to be a mover and
shaker the last five years my batting average
is  thats that and leroi comes in
and tells me miles davis was clubbed 
times last night outside birdland by a cop
a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible
disease but we dont give her one we
dont like terrible diseases then

we go eat some fish and some ale its
cool but crowded we dont like lionel trilling
we decide we like don allen we dont like
henry james so much we like herman melville
we dont want to be in the poets walk in
san francisco even we just want to be rich
and walk on girders in our silver hats
i wonder if one person out of the  is
thinking of me as i shake hands with leroi
and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go
back to work happy at the thought possibly so
i know that i shall meet my fate
somewhere among the clouds above
those that i fight i do not hate
those that i guard i do not love
my country is kiltartan cross
my countrymen kiltartans poor
no likely end could bring them loss
or leave them happier than before
nor law nor duty bade me fight
nor public men nor cheering crowds
a lonely impulse of delight
drove to this tumult in the clouds
i balanced all brought all to mind
the years to come seemed waste of breath
a waste of breath the years behind
in balance with this life this death
praise the restless beds
praise the beds that do not adjust
     that wont lift the head to feed
     or lower for shots
     or blood
     or raise to watch the tinny tv
praise the hotel tv that wont quit
      its murmur  holler
praise the room service
      that doesnt exist
      just the slow delivery to the front desk
      of cooling pizzas
       brown bags leaky
      greasy  clear
praise the vending machines
praise the change
praise the hot water
 the heat
       or the loud cool
       that helps the helpless sleep

praise the front desk
       who knows to wake
       rm  when the hospital rings
praise the silent phone
praise the dark drawn
       by thick daytime curtains
       after long nights of waiting
       awake

praise the waiting  then praise the nothing
       thats better than bad news
praise the wakeup call
       at  am
praise the sleeping in
praise the card hung on the door
       like a whisper
       lips pressed silent
praise the strangers hands
       that change the sweat of sheets
praise the checking out

praise the going home
       to beds unmade
       for days
beds that wont resurrect
       or rise
that lie there like a child should
        sleeping tubeless

praise this mess
         that can be left
wake to find everything black
what was white all the vice
versawhite maids on tv black

sitcoms that star white dwarfs
cute as pearl buttons black presidents
black houses white horse

candidates all bleach burns
clothes black drive roads
white as you are white songs

on the radio stolen by black bands
like secret pancake recipes white back up
singers ball players  boxers all

white as tar feathers on chickens
dark as everything boiling in the pot
that called the kettle honky even

whites of the eye turn dark pupils
clear  changing as a cats
is this what weve wanted

 waited for to see snow
covering everything black
as christmas dark pages written

white upon all our eclipses bright
dark stars shooting across pale
sky glowing like ash in fire shower

every skin only money keeps
green still grows  burns like grass
under dark daylight

how much delight before we collapse
how much earth in the lungs
how much wine

when we want more
when the weeds sprawl
it is not what you think

think how fast some landscapes change
the lover the gardeners grand idea
the failing maple

the boat about to capsize
the correction
the hands reflection

the impossible replication of weight
versus time
how it will never mean what you want
late august given heavy rain and sun
for a full week the blackberries would ripen
at first just one a glossy purple clot
among others red green hard as a knot
you ate that first one and its flesh was sweet
like thickened wine summers blood was in it
leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for
picking then red ones inked up and that hunger
sent us out with milk cans pea tins jam pots
where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots
round hayfields cornfields and potato drills
we trekked and picked until the cans were full
until the tinkling bottom had been covered
with green ones and on top big dark blobs burned
like a plate of eyes our hands were peppered
with thorn pricks our palms sticky as bluebeards

we hoarded the fresh berries in the byre
but when the bath was filled we found a fur
a rat grey fungus glutting on our cache
the juice was stinking too once off the bush
the fruit fermented the sweet flesh would turn sour
i always felt like crying it wasnt fair
that all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot
each year i hoped theyd keep knew they would not
try to praise the mutilated world
remember junes long days
and wild strawberries drops of ros wine
the nettles that methodically overgrow
the abandoned homesteads of exiles
you must praise the mutilated world
you watched the stylish yachts and ships
one of them had a long trip ahead of it
while salty oblivion awaited others
youve seen the refugees going nowhere
youve heard the executioners sing joyfully
you should praise the mutilated world
remember the moments when we were together
in a white room and the curtain fluttered
return in thought to the concert where music flared
you gathered acorns in the park in autumn
and leaves eddied over the earths scars
praise the mutilated world
and the gray feather a thrush lost
and the gentle light that strays and vanishes
and returns
this night nurse is different
she walks into my room and does not turn the light on
she thinks i am sleeping
i have just barely opened my left eye
am looking through the slightest slit
as moonlight exposes the room
for what it really isa collection
of surfaces lines and planes mostly
the night nurse puts a foot up on the radiator
and braces her clipboard on her knee
as she appears to take down a few notes
i imagine she is working on a sonnet
and that her ankle looks like polished walnut
you imagine she is working on a crossword
and that her feet are killing her
the slightest slit is like an old gate
at a japanese tea garden at night
in the rain that is supposed to be closed
that is supposed to be locked
someone has locked up poorly youd say
incorrectly but no one has asked you
there are birds here
so many birds here
is what i was trying to say
when they said those birds were metaphors
for what is trapped
between buildings
and buildings no
the birds are here
to root around for bread
the girls hands tear
and toss like confetti no
i dont mean the bread is torn like cotton
i said confetti and no
not the confetti
a tank can make of a building
i mean the confetti
a boy cant stop smiling about
and no his smile isnt much
like a skeleton at all and no
his neighborhood is not like a war zone
i am trying to say
his neighborhood
is as tattered and feathered
as anything else
as shadow pierced by sun
and light parted
by shadow dance as anything else
but they wont stop saying
how lovely the ruins
how ruined the lovely
children must be in that birdless city
a bird came down the walk   
he did not know i saw  
he bit an angle worm in halves
and ate the fellow raw 
 
and then he drank a dew
from a convenient grass  
and then hopped sidewise to the wall
to let a beetle pass  
 
he glanced with rapid eyes
that hurried all abroad  
they looked like frightened beads i thought
he stirred his velvet head   
 
like one in danger cautious
i offered him a crumb
and he unrolled his feathers 
and rowed him softer home  
 
than oars divide the ocean
too silver for a seam
or butterflies off banks of noon
leap plashless as they swim 
my song has put off her adornments
she has no pride of dress and decoration
ornaments would mar our union
they would come between thee and me
their jingling would drown thy whispers
 
my poets vanity dies in shame before thy sight
o master poet i have sat down at thy feet
only let me make my life simple and straight
like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music
when you were building the i  bypass
one of your dozers moving earth
at the center of a great pit
slipped its thick blade beneath
the water table slicing into the earths
wet palm and the silt moistened
beneath the huge things tires and the crew
was sent home for the day
next morning water filled the pit
nothing anyone could do to stop it coming
it was a revelation kidney shaped deep
green there between the interstate
and the sewage treatment plant
when nothing else worked you called it
a lake and opened it to the public
and we were the public
my mother sends me a black and white
photograph of her and my father circa
 posing with two indian men

who are those indian guys i ask her
on the phone

i dont know she says

the next obvious question then why
did you send me this photo but i dont
ask it

one of those strange indian men is
pointing up toward the sky

above them a bird shaped like a
question mark

this is a world where there are monsters
there are monsters everywhere racoons and skunks
there are possums outside there are monsters in my bed
there is one monster he is my little one
i talk to my little monster
i give my little monster some bacon but that does not satisfy him
i tell him ssh ssh dont growl little monster
and he growls oh boy does he growl
and he wants something from me
he wants my soul
and finally giving in i give him my gleaming soul
and as he eats my gleaming soul i am one with him
and stare out his eyepits and i see nothing but white
and then i see nothing but fog and the white i had seen before was nothing but fog
and there is nothing but fog out the eyes of monsters
superman flies onto his first comic book
oil bubbles up in saudi arabia
orson welles the war of the worlds invades
every panicked radio along the eastern seaboard
the spanish civil war rages on filming starts
on the wizard of oz at new york citys
carnegie hall john hammonds spirituals
to swing concert explodes with african chants
the count basie band boogie woogie
new orleans jazz hot gospel stride piano
harmonica instrumentals big bill broonzys
blues the audience hears the ghost of robert
johnson four months gone easing out
of a victrola phonograph at center stage
the entire concert suddenly enveloped
by the man who was not there

mister johnson

mister johnson
in devil may care control
mister johnson
dont thank me for the favor
mister johnson
i thank you for your soul
jook joints about to come alive
its like a bee outside a hive
and when the hive begins to hum
its like a dim and distant drum
and when the drum begins to beat
its like a circus down the street
and when the street begins to fill
its like a sudden summer chill
and just as summer simmers down
its like the fireworks over town
dont matter what the preachers say
this congregations here to stay
cause when the jook joint comes alive
is when the delta blues arrive
lady could pour you a song
coffee and a little cream
stir it the whole night long
into a brown sugar dream

lady could wrap you a note
up in a velvet night
sometimes manhattan satin
always harlem delight

lady day could sing it
like nobody ever has
at the shim sham club hot cha cha
joints that swung on jazz

her bittersweet songs told heartbreak
meet your sister pain
but lady melted yesterdays
into beautiful rain
pour o pour that parting soul in song
o pour it in the sawdust glow of night
into the velvet pine smoke air tonight
and let the valley carry it along
and let the valley carry it along

o land and soil red soil and sweet gum tree
so scant of grass so profligate of pines
now just before an epochs sun declines
thy son in time i have returned to thee
