to celebrate the joyous day
when we regained the right to pray
to our one god in our own way
my mother bore me in the southern wild
and i am black but o my soul is white
white as an angel is the english child 
but i am black as if bereavd of light

my mother taught me underneath a tree 
and sitting down before the heat of day
she took me on her lap and kissed me
and pointing to the east began to say 

look on the rising sun there god does live 
and gives his light and gives his heat away 
and flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
comfort in morning joy in the noonday

and we are put on earth a little space
that we may learn to bear the beams of love 
and these black bodies and this sun burnt face
is but a cloud and like a shady grove

for when our souls have learnd the heat to bear 
the cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice 
saying come out from the grove my love  care
and round my golden tent like lambs rejoice

thus did my mother say and kissed me 
and thus i say to little english boy 
when i from black and he from white cloud free
and round the tent of god like lambs we joy 

ill shade him from the heat till he can bear 
to lean in joy upon our fathers knee 
and then ill stand and stroke his silver hair
and be like him and he will then love me
little tree
little silent christmas tree
you are so little
you are more like a flower

who found you in the green forest
and were you very sorry to come away
see          i will comfort you
because you smell so sweetly

i will kiss your cool bark
and hug you safe and tight
just as your mother would
only dont be afraid

look          the spangles
that sleep all the year in a dark box
dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine
the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads

put up your little arms
and ill give them all to you to hold
every finger shall have its ring
and there wont be a single place dark or unhappy

then when youre quite dressed
youll stand in the window for everyone to see
and how theyll stare
oh but youll be very proud

and my little sister and i will take hands
and looking up at our beautiful tree
well dance and sing

something there is that doesnt love a wall
that sends the frozen ground swell under it
and spills the upper boulders in the sun
and makes gaps even two can pass abreast
the work of hunters is another thing
i have come after them and made repair
where they have left not one stone on a stone
but they would have the rabbit out of hiding
to please the yelping dogs the gaps i mean
no one has seen them made or heard them made
but at spring mending time we find them there
i let my neighbor know beyond the hill
and on a day we meet to walk the line
and set the wall between us once again
we keep the wall between us as we go
to each the boulders that have fallen to each
and some are loaves and some so nearly balls
we have to use a spell to make them balance
stay where you are until our backs are turned
we wear our fingers rough with handling them
oh just another kind of out door game
one on a side it comes to little more
there where it is we do not need the wall
he is all pine and i am apple orchard
my apple trees will never get across
and eat the cones under his pines i tell him
he only says good fences make good neighbors
spring is the mischief in me and i wonder
if i could put a notion in his head
why do they make good neighbors isnt it
where there are cows but here there are no cows
before i built a wall id ask to know
what i was walling in or walling out
and to whom i was like to give offense
something there is that doesnt love a wall
that wants it down i could say elves to him
but its not elves exactly and id rather
he said it for himself i see him there
bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
in each hand like an old stone savage armed
he moves in darkness as it seems to me
not of woods only and the shade of trees
he will not go behind his fathers saying
and he likes having thought of it so well
he says again good fences make good neighbors
i made a sand castle
in rolled the sea
            all sand castles
            belong to me
            to me
said the sea

i dug sand tunnels
in flowed the sea
            all sand tunnels
            belong to me
            to me
said the sea

i saw my sand pail floating free
i ran and snatched it from the sea
            my sand pail
            belongs to me
            to me
d the dreadful dinotherium he   
will have to do his best for d   
the early world observed with awe   
his back indented like a saw
his look was gay his voice was strong   
his tail was neither short nor long   
his trunk or elongated nose
was not so large as some suppose   
his teeth as all the world allows   
were graminivorous like a cows
he therefore should have wished to pass   
long peaceful nights upon the grass   
but being mad the brute preferred
to roost in branches like a bird
a creature heavier than a whale   
you see at once could hardly fail
to suffer badly when he slid
and tumbled as he always did
his fossil therefore comes to light
all broken up and serve him right

the moral of this verse
is applicable to the young be terse


k for the klondyke a country of gold   
where the winters are often excessively cold
where the lawn every morning is covered with rime   
and skating continues for years at a time   
do you think that a climate can conquer the grit   
of the sons of the west not a bit not a bit   
when the weather looks nippy the bold pioneers   
put on two pairs of stockings and cover their ears   
and roam through the drear hyperborean dales   
with a vast apparatus of buckets and pails   
or wander through wild hyperborean glades
with hoes hammers pickaxes mattocks and spades   
there are some who give rise to exuberant mirth   
by turning up nothing but bushels of earth   
while those who have little cause excellent fun   
by attempting to pilfer from those who have none   
at times the reward they will get for their pains   
is to strike very tempting auriferous veins   
or a shaft being sunk for some miles in the ground   
not infrequently nuggets of value are found   
they bring us the gold when their labours are ended   
and weafter thanking them prettilyspend it

ive known rivers
ive known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins

my soul has grown deep like the rivers

i bathed in the euphrates when dawns were young
i built my hut near the congo and it lulled me to sleep
i looked upon the nile and raised the pyramids above it
i heard the singing of the mississippi when abe lincoln went down to new orleans and ive seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset

ive known rivers
ancient dusky rivers

my soul has grown deep like the rivers

o captain my captain our fearful trip is done
the ship has weatherd every rack the prize we sought is won
the port is near the bells i hear the people all exulting
while follow eyes the steady keel the vessel grim and daring
                         but o heart heart heart
                            o the bleeding drops of red
                               where on the deck my captain lies
                                  fallen cold and dead

o captain my captain rise up and hear the bells
rise upfor you the flag is flungfor you the bugle trills
for you bouquets and ribbond wreathsfor you the shores a crowding
for you they call the swaying mass their eager faces turning
                         here captain dear father
                            this arm beneath your head
                               it is some dream that on the deck
                                 youve fallen cold and dead

my captain does not answer his lips are pale and still
my father does not feel my arm he has no pulse nor will
the ship is anchord safe and sound its voyage closed and done
from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won
                         exult o shores and ring o bells
                            but i with mournful tread
                               walk the deck my captain lies
                                  fallen cold and dead

thou still unravishd bride of quietness
       thou foster child of silence and slow time
sylvan historian who canst thus express
       a flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme
what leaf fringd legend haunts about thy shape
       of deities or mortals or of both
               in tempe or the dales of arcady
       what men or gods are these what maidens loth
what mad pursuit what struggle to escape
               what pipes and timbrels what wild ecstasy

heard melodies are sweet but those unheard
       are sweeter therefore ye soft pipes play on
not to the sensual ear but more endeard
       pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone
fair youth beneath the trees thou canst not leave
       thy song nor ever can those trees be bare
               bold lover never never canst thou kiss
though winning near the goal yet do not grieve
       she cannot fade though thou hast not thy bliss
               for ever wilt thou love and she be fair

ah happy happy boughs that cannot shed
         your leaves nor ever bid the spring adieu
and happy melodist unwearied
         for ever piping songs for ever new
more happy love more happy happy love
         for ever warm and still to be enjoyd
                for ever panting and for ever young
all breathing human passion far above
         that leaves a heart high sorrowful and cloyd
                a burning forehead and a parching tongue

who are these coming to the sacrifice
         to what green altar o mysterious priest
leadst thou that heifer lowing at the skies
         and all her silken flanks with garlands drest
what little town by river or sea shore
         or mountain built with peaceful citadel
                is emptied of this folk this pious morn
and little town thy streets for evermore
         will silent be and not a soul to tell
                why thou art desolate can eer return

o attic shape fair attitude with brede
         of marble men and maidens overwrought
with forest branches and the trodden weed
         thou silent form dost tease us out of thought
as doth eternity cold pastoral
         when old age shall this generation waste
                thou shalt remain in midst of other woe
than ours a friend to man to whom thou sayst
         beauty is truth truth beautythat is all
                ye know on earth and all ye need to know


twas mercy brought me from my pagan land
taught my benighted soul to understand
that theres a god that theres a saviour too
once i redemption neither sought nor knew
some view our sable race with scornful eye
their colour is a diabolic die
remember christians negros black as cain
may be refind and join th angelic train
o thou bright jewel in my aim i strive
to comprehend thee thine own words declare
wisdom is higher than a fool can reach
i cease to wonder and no more attempt
thine height texplore or fathom thy profound
but o my soul sink not into despair
virtue is near thee and with gentle hand
would now embrace thee hovers oer thine head
fain would the heaven born soul with her converse
then seek then court her for her promised bliss

auspicious queen thine heavenly pinions spread
and lead celestial chastity along
lo now her sacred retinue descends
arrayed in glory from the orbs above
attend me virtue thro my youthful years
o leave me not to the false joys of time
but guide my steps to endless life and bliss
greatness or goodness say what i shall call thee
to give an higher appellation still
teach me a better strain a nobler lay
o thou enthroned with cherubs in the realms of day

he counts potatoes dug from the brown field   
counting the seed counting   
the cellars portion out   
and bags the rest on the carts floor

he packs wool sheared in april honey
in combs linen leather   
tanned from deerhide   
and vinegar in a barrel
hooped by hand at the forges fire

he walks by his oxs head ten days
to portsmouth market and sells potatoes   
and the bag that carried potatoes
flaxseed birch brooms maple sugar goose   
feathers yarn

when the cart is empty he sells the cart   
when the cart is sold he sells the ox   
harness and yoke and walks
home his pockets heavy
with the years coin for salt and taxes

and at home by fires light in november cold   
stitches new harness
for next years ox in the barn
and carves the yoke and saws planks   
building the cart again

glory be to god for dappled things 
   for skies of couple colour as a brinded cow
      for rose moles all in stipple upon trout that swim
fresh firecoal chestnut falls finches wings

      and ll trdes their gear and tackle and trim

all things counter original spare strange
   whatever is fickle freckled who knows how

i was angry with my friend 
i told my wrath my wrath did end
i was angry with my foe 
i told it not my wrath did grow 

and i waterd it in fears
night  morning with my tears 
and i sunned it with smiles
and with soft deceitful wiles 

and it grew both day and night 
till it bore an apple bright 
and my foe beheld it shine
and he knew that it was mine 

and into my garden stole 
when the night had veild the pole 
in the morning glad i see 
my foe outstretched beneath the tree
o my luve is like a red red rose
   thats newly sprung in june
o my luve is like the melody
   thats sweetly played in tune

so fair art thou my bonnie lass
   so deep in luve am i
and i will luve thee still my dear
   till a the seas gang dry

till a the seas gang dry my dear
   and the rocks melt wi the sun
i will love thee still my dear
   while the sands o life shall run

and fare thee weel my only luve
   and fare thee weel awhile
and i will come again my luve
   though it were ten thousand mile
two roads diverged in a yellow wood
and sorry i could not travel both
and be one traveler long i stood
and looked down one as far as i could
to where it bent in the undergrowth

then took the other as just as fair
and having perhaps the better claim
because it was grassy and wanted wear
though as for that the passing there
had worn them really about the same

and both that morning equally lay
in leaves no step had trodden black
oh i kept the first for another day
yet knowing how way leads on to way
i doubted if i should ever come back

i shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence
two roads diverged in a wood and i
i took the one less traveled by
and that has made all the difference

loveliest of trees the cherry now
is hung with bloom along the bough
and stands about the woodland ride
wearing white for eastertide

now of my threescore years and ten
twenty will not come again
and take from seventy springs a score
it only leaves me fifty more

and since to look at things in bloom
fifty springs are little room
about the woodlands i will go
to see the cherry hung with snow

so well go no more a roving
   so late into the night
though the heart be still as loving
   and the moon be still as bright

for the sword outwears its sheath
   and the soul wears out the breast
and the heart must pause to breathe
   and love itself have rest

though the night was made for loving
   and the day returns too soon
yet well go no more a roving
   by the light of the moon
go and catch a falling star
    get with child a mandrake root
tell me where all past years are
    or who cleft the devils foot
teach me to hear mermaids singing
or to keep off envys stinging
            and find
            what wind
serves to advance an honest mind

if thou best born to strange sights
    things invisible to see
ride ten thousand days and nights
    till age snow white hairs on thee
thou when thou returnst wilt tell me
all strange wonders that befell thee
            and swear
            no where
lives a woman true and fair

if thou findst one let me know
    such a pilgrimage were sweet
yet do not i would not go
    though at next door we might meet
though she were true when you met her
and last till you write your letter
            yet she
            will be
false ere i come to two or three
go and catch a falling star
    get with child a mandrake root
tell me where all past years are
    or who cleft the devils foot
teach me to hear mermaids singing
or to keep off envys stinging
            and find
            what wind
serves to advance an honest mind

if thou best born to strange sights
    things invisible to see
ride ten thousand days and nights
    till age snow white hairs on thee
thou when thou returnst wilt tell me
all strange wonders that befell thee
            and swear
            no where
lives a woman true and fair

if thou findst one let me know
    such a pilgrimage were sweet
yet do not i would not go
    though at next door we might meet
though she were true when you met her
and last till you write your letter
            yet she
            will be
false ere i come to two or three
double double toil and trouble
fire burn and caldron bubble
fillet of a fenny snake
in the caldron boil and bake
eye of newt and toe of frog
wool of bat and tongue of dog
adders fork and blind worms sting
lizards leg and howlets wing
for a charm of powerful trouble
like a hell broth boil and bubble

double double toil and trouble
fire burn and caldron bubble
cool it with a baboons blood
then the charm is firm and good
whose woods these are i think i know   
his house is in the village though   
he will not see me stopping here   
to watch his woods fill up with snow   

my little horse must think it queer   
to stop without a farmhouse near   
between the woods and frozen lake   
the darkest evening of the year   

he gives his harness bells a shake   
to ask if there is some mistake   
the only other sounds the sweep   
of easy wind and downy flake   

the woods are lovely dark and deep   
but i have promises to keep   
and miles to go before i sleep   
and miles to go before i sleep
billy in one of his nice new sashes
fell in the fire and was burned to ashes

i am twenty two colored born in winston salem   
i went to school there then durham then here   
to this college on the hill above harlem   
i am the only colored student in my class   
the steps from the hill lead down into harlem   
through a park then i cross st nicholas   
eighth avenue seventh and i come to the y   
the harlem branch y where i take the elevator   
up to my room sit down and write this page

its not easy to know what is true for you or me   
at twenty two my age but i guess im what
i feel and see and hear harlem i hear you
hear you hear mewe twoyou me talk on this page   
i hear new york too mewho

well i like to eat sleep drink and be in love   
i like to work read learn and understand life   
i like a pipe for a christmas present
or recordsbessie bop or bach
i guess being colored doesnt make me not like
the same things other folks like who are other races   
so will my page be colored that i write   
being me it will not be white
but it will be
a part of you instructor
you are white
yet a part of me as i am a part of you
thats american
sometimes perhaps you dont want to be a part of me   
nor do i often want to be a part of you
but we are thats true
as i learn from you
i guess you learn from me
although youre olderand white
and somewhat more free
sundays too my father got up early
and put his clothes on in the blueblack cold
then with cracked hands that ached
from labor in the weekday weather made
banked fires blaze no one ever thanked him

id wake and hear the cold splintering breaking
when the rooms were warm hed call
and slowly i would rise and dress
fearing the chronic angers of that house

speaking indifferently to him
who had driven out the cold
and polished my good shoes as well
what did i know what did i know
of loves austere and lonely offices
bananas ripe and green and ginger root
      cocoa in pods and alligator pears
and tangerines and mangoes and grape fruit
      fit for the highest prize at parish fairs

set in the window bringing memories
      of fruit trees laden by low singing rills
and dewy dawns and mystical blue skies
      in benediction over nun like hills

my eyes grew dim and i could no more gaze
      a wave of longing through my body swept
and hungry for the old familiar ways
      i turned aside and bowed my head and wept
jeremiah dickson was a true blue american
for he was a little boy who understood america for he felt that he must
think about everything because thats all there is to think about   
knowing immediately the intimacy of truth and comedy   
knowing intuitively how a sense of humor was a necessity   
for one and for all who live in america thus natively and   
naturally when on an april sunday in an ice cream parlor jeremiah   
was requested to choose between a chocolate sundae and a banana split
he answered unhesitatingly having no need to think of it
being a true blue american determined to continue as he began   
rejecting the either or of kierkegaard and many another european   
refusing to accept alternatives refusing to believe the choice of between
rejecting selection denying dilemma electing absolute affirmation knowing
         in his breast
                  the infinite and the gold
                  of the endless frontier the deathless west

both i will have them both declared this true blue american   
in cambridge massachusetts on an april sunday instructed
         by the great department stores by the five and ten
taught by christmas by the circus by the vulgarity and grandeur of
         niagara falls and the grand canyon
tutored by the grandeur vulgarity and infinite appetite gratified and   
         shining in the darkness of the light
on saturdays at the double bills of the moon pictures
the consummation of the advertisements of the imagination of the light
which is as it wasthe infinite belief in infinite hopeof columbus

tyger tyger burning bright 
in the forests of the night 
what immortal hand or eye 
could frame thy fearful symmetry

in what distant deeps or skies 
burnt the fire of thine eyes
on what wings dare he aspire
what the hand dare seize the fire

and what shoulder  what art
could twist the sinews of thy heart
and when thy heart began to beat
what dread hand  what dread feet

what the hammer what the chain 
in what furnace was thy brain
what the anvil what dread grasp 
dare its deadly terrors clasp 

when the stars threw down their spears 
and waterd heaven with their tears 
did he smile his work to see
did he who made the lamb make thee

tyger tyger burning bright 
in the forests of the night 
what immortal hand or eye
dare frame thy fearful symmetry

mrs coleys three flat brick
isnt here any more
all done with seeing her fat little form   
burst out of the basement door
and with seeing her african son in law   
rightful heir to the throne
with his great white strong cold squares of teeth   
and his little eyes of stone
and with seeing the squat fat daughter   
letting in the men
when majesty has gone for the day
and letting them out again
