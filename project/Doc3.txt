thy son i have in time returned to thee

in time for though the sun is setting on
a song lit race of slaves it has not set
though late o soil it is not too late yet
to catch thy plaintive soul leaving soon gone
leaving to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone

o negro slaves dark purple ripened plums
squeezed and bursting in the pine wood air
passing before they stripped the old tree bare
one plum was saved for me one seed becomes

an everlasting song a singing tree
caroling softly souls of slavery
what they were and what they are to me
caroling softly souls of slavery
as a boy i bicycled the block
wa brown mop top falling
into a tail bleached blond

gold like under golden light
like colors of noble knights
banging on corners unconcerned

wthe colors i borea shorty
too small to war with too brown
to be down for the block

white knights became brown
kings still showing black  gold
on corners now crowned

the block a branch branded
wla corona graffitied on
garage doors by the pawns

as a teen i couldve beamed
the crown walked in wout
the beat down custom

warred wmy cousin
who claimed two six
the set on the next block

decked in black  beige
but i preferred games to gangs
books to crooks wearing hats

crooked to the left or right
fighting for a plot a block
to spot  mark wblood

of boys who knew no better
way to grow up than throw up
the crown  be down for whatever
downhill i came hungry and yet not starved
cold yet had heat within me that was proof
against the north wind tired yet so that rest
had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof

then at the inn i had food fire and rest
knowing how hungry cold and tired was i
all of the night was quite barred out except
an owls cry a most melancholy cry

shaken out long and clear upon the hill
no merry note nor cause of merriment
but one telling me plain what i escaped
and others could not that night as in i went

and salted was my food and my repose
salted and sobered too by the birds voice
speaking for all who lay under the stars
soldiers and poor unable to rejoice
my candle burns at both ends
   it will not last the night
but ah my foes and oh my friends
   it gives a lovely light
christmas eve and twelve of the clock
now they are all on their knees
an elder said as we sat in a flock
by the embers in hearthside ease

we pictured the meek mild creatures where
they dwelt in their strawy pen
nor did it occur to one of us there
to doubt they were kneeling then

so fair a fancy few would weave
in these years yet i feel
if someone said on christmas eve
come see the oxen kneel

in the lonely barton by yonder coomb
our childhood used to know
i should go with him in the gloom
hoping it might be so
i am offering this poem to you
since i have nothing else to give
keep it like a warm coat
when winter comes to cover you
or like a pair of thick socks
the cold cannot bite through

                         i love you

i have nothing else to give you
so it is a pot full of yellow corn
to warm your belly in winter
it is a scarf for your head to wear
over your hair to tie up around your face

                         i love you

keep it treasure this as you would
if you were lost needing direction
in the wilderness life becomes when mature
and in the corner of your drawer
tucked away like a cabin or hogan
in dense trees come knocking
and i will answer give you directions
and let you warm yourself by this fire
rest by this fire and make you feel safe

                         i love you

its all i have to give
and all anyone needs to live
and to go on living inside
when the world outside
no longer cares if you live or die
remember

                         i love you
i am four in this photograph standing   
on a wide strip of mississippi beach   
my hands on the flowered hips

of a bright bikini my toes dig in   
curl around wet sand the sun cuts   
the rippling gulf in flashes with each   

tidal rush minnows dart at my feet
glinting like switchblades i am alone
except for my grandmother other side   

of the camera telling me how to pose   
it is  two years after they opened   
the rest of this beach to us   

forty years since the photograph   
where she stood on a narrow plot   
of sand marked colored smiling

her hands on the flowered hips   
of a cotton meal sack dress

closed mondays

is music    is men
off early from work    is waiting
for the chance at the chair
while the eagle claws holes
in your pockets    keeping
time    by the turning
of rusty fans    steel flowers with
cold breezes    is having nothing
better to do    than guess at the years
of hair    matted beneath the soiled caps
of drunks    the pain of running
a fisted comb through stubborn
knots    is the dark dirty low
down blues    the tender heads
of sons fresh from cornrows    all
wonder at losing    half their height
is a mother gathering hair    for good
luck    for a soft wig    is the round
difficulty of ears    the peach
faced boys asking eddie
to cut in parts and arrows
wanting to have their names read
for just a few days    and among thin
jazz    is the quick brush of a done
head    the black flood around
your feet    grandfathers
stopping their games of ivory
dominoes    just before they reach the bone
yard    is winking widowers announcing
cut it clean off    im through courting
and hair only gets in the way    is the final
spin of the chair    a reflection of
a reflection    that sting of wintergreen
tonic    on the neck of a sleeping snow
haired man    when you realize it is
your turn    you are next
when i was a child i knew red miners
dressed raggedly and wearing carbide lamps
i saw them come down red hills to their camps
dyed with red dust from old ishkooda mines
night after night i met them on the roads
or on the streets in town i caught their glance
the swing of dinner buckets in their hands
and grumbling undermining all their words

i also lived in low cotton country
where moonlight hovered over ripe haystacks
or stumps of trees and croppers rotting shacks
with famine terror flood and plague near by
where sentiment and hatred still held sway
and only bitter land was washed away

when i was one and twenty
       i heard a wise man say
give crowns and pounds and guineas
       but not your heart away
give pearls away and rubies
       but keep your fancy free
but i was one and twenty
       no use to talk to me

when i was one and twenty
       i heard him say again
the heart out of the bosom
       was never given in vain
tis paid with sighs a plenty
       and sold for endless rue
and i am two and twenty
       and oh tis true tis true

i feel myself in need
   of the inspiring strains of ancient lore
my heart to lift my empty mind to feed
   and all the world explore

i know that i am old
   and never can recover what is past
but for the future may some light unfold
   and soar from ages blast

i feel resolved to try
   my wish to prove my calling to pursue
or mount up from the earth into the sky
   to show what heaven can do

my genius from a boy
   has fluttered like a bird within my heart
but could not thus confined her powers employ
   impatient to depart

she like a restless bird
   would spread her wing her power to be unfurld
and let her songs be loudly heard
   and dart from world to world
just the place for a snark the bellman cried
   as he landed his crew with care
supporting each man on the top of the tide
   by a finger entwined in his hair

just the place for a snark i have said it twice
   that alone should encourage the crew
just the place for a snark i have said it thrice
   what i tell you three times is true

the crew was complete it included a boots
   a maker of bonnets and hoods
a barrister brought to arrange their disputes
   and a broker to value their goods

a billiard marker whose skill was immense
   might perhaps have won more than his share
but a banker engaged at enormous expense
   had the whole of their cash in his care

there was also a beaver that paced on the deck
   or would sit making lace in the bow
and had often the bellman said saved them from wreck
   though none of the sailors knew how

there was one who was famed for the number of things
   he forgot when he entered the ship
his umbrella his watch all his jewels and rings
   and the clothes he had bought for the trip

he had forty two boxes all carefully packed
   with his name painted clearly on each
but since he omitted to mention the fact
   they were all left behind on the beach

the loss of his clothes hardly mattered because
   he had seven coats on when he came
with three pair of bootsbut the worst of it was
   he had wholly forgotten his name

he would answer to hi or to any loud cry
   such as fry me or fritter my wig
to what you may call um or what was his name
   but especially thing um a jig

while for those who preferred a more forcible word
   he had different names from these
his intimate friends called him candle ends
   and his enemies toasted cheese

his form is ungainlyhis intellect small
   so the bellman would often remark
but his courage is perfect and that after all
   is the thing that one needs with a snark

he would joke with hnas returning their stare
   with an impudent wag of the head
and he once went a walk paw in paw with a bear
   just to keep up its spirits he said

he came as a baker but owned when too late
   and it drove the poor bellman half mad
he could only bake bride cakefor which i may state
   no materials were to be had

the last of the crew needs especial remark
   though he looked an incredible dunce
he had just one ideabut that one being snark
   the good bellman engaged him at once

he came as a butcher but gravely declared
   when the ship had been sailing a week
he could only kill beavers the bellman looked scared
   and was almost too frightened to speak

but at length he explained in a tremulous tone
   there was only one beaver on board
and that was a tame one he had of his own
   whose death would be deeply deplored

the beaver who happened to hear the remark
   protested with tears in its eyes
that not even the rapture of hunting the snark
   could atone for that dismal surprise

it strongly advised that the butcher should be
   conveyed in a separate ship
but the bellman declared that would never agree
   with the plans he had made for the trip

navigation was always a difficult art
   though with only one ship and one bell
and he feared he must really decline for his part
   undertaking another as well

the beavers best course was no doubt to procure
   a second hand dagger proof coat
so the baker advised itand next to insure
   its life in some office of note

this the banker suggested and offered for hire
   on moderate terms or for sale
two excellent policies one against fire
   and one against damage from hail

yet still ever after that sorrowful day
   whenever the butcher was by
the beaver kept looking the opposite way
   and appeared unaccountably shy

                  fit the second
                      the bellmans speech

the bellman himself they all praised to the skies
   such a carriage such ease and such grace
such solemnity too one could see he was wise
   the moment one looked in his face

he had bought a large map representing the sea
   without the least vestige of land
and the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
   a map they could all understand

whats the good of mercators north poles and equators
   tropics zones and meridian lines
so the bellman would cry and the crew would reply
   they are merely conventional signs

other maps are such shapes with their islands and capes
   but weve got our brave captain to thank
so the crew would protest that hes bought us the best
   a perfect and absolute blank

this was charming no doubt but they shortly found out
   that the captain they trusted so well
had only one notion for crossing the ocean
   and that was to tingle his bell

he was thoughtful and gravebut the orders he gave
   were enough to bewilder a crew
when he cried steer to starboard but keep her head larboard
   what on earth was the helmsman to do

then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes
   a thing as the bellman remarked
that frequently happens in tropical climes
   when a vessel is so to speak snarked

but the principal failing occurred in the sailing
   and the bellman perplexed and distressed
said he had hoped at least when the wind blew due east
   that the ship would not travel due west

but the danger was pastthey had landed at last
   with their boxes portmanteaus and bags
yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view
   which consisted to chasms and crags

the bellman perceived that their spirits were low
   and repeated in musical tone
some jokes he had kept for a season of woe
   but the crew would do nothing but groan

he served out some grog with a liberal hand
   and bade them sit down on the beach
and they could not but own that their captain looked grand
   as he stood and delivered his speech

friends romans and countrymen lend me your ears
   they were all of them fond of quotations
so they drank to his health and they gave him three cheers
   while he served out additional rations

we have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks
   four weeks to the month you may mark
but never as yet tis your captain who speaks
   have we caught the least glimpse of a snark

we have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days
   seven days to the week i allow
but a snark on the which we might lovingly gaze
   we have never beheld till now

come listen my men while i tell you again
   the five unmistakable marks
by which you may know wheresoever you go
   the warranted genuine snarks

let us take them in order the first is the taste
   which is meagre and hollow but crisp
like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist
   with a flavour of will o the wisp

its habit of getting up late youll agree
   that it carries too far when i say
that it frequently breakfasts at five oclock tea
   and dines on the following day

the third is its slowness in taking a jest
   should you happen to venture on one
it will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed
   and it always looks grave at a pun

the fourth is its fondness for bathing machines
   which it constantly carries about
and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes
   a sentiment open to doubt

the fifth is ambition it next will be right
   to describe each particular batch
distinguishing those that have feathers and bite
   from those that have whiskers and scratch

for although common snarks do no manner of harm
   yet i feel it my duty to say
some are boojums the bellman broke off in alarm
   for the baker had fainted away

            fit the third
               the bakers tale

they roused him with muffinsthey roused him with ice
   they roused him with mustard and cress
they roused him with jam and judicious advice
   they set him conundrums to guess

when at length he sat up and was able to speak
   his sad story he offered to tell
and the bellman cried silence not even a shriek
   and excitedly tingled his bell

there was silence supreme not a shriek not a scream
   scarcely even a howl or a groan
as the man they called ho told his story of woe
   in an antediluvian tone

my father and mother were honest though poor
   skip all that cried the bellman in haste
if it once becomes dark theres no chance of a snark
   we have hardly a minute to waste

i skip forty years said the baker in tears
   and proceed without further remark
to the day when you took me aboard of your ship
   to help you in hunting the snark

a dear uncle of mine after whom i was named
   remarked when i bade him farewell
oh skip your dear uncle the bellman exclaimed
   as he angrily tingled his bell

he remarked to me then said that mildest of men
   if your snark be a snark that is right
fetch it home by all meansyou may serve it with greens
   and its handy for striking a light

you may seek it with thimblesand seek it with care
   you may hunt it with forks and hope
you may threaten its life with a railway share
   you may charm it with smiles and soap

thats exactly the method the bellman bold
   in a hasty parenthesis cried
thats exactly the way i have always been told
   that the capture of snarks should be tried

but oh beamish nephew beware of the day
   if your snark be a boojum for then
you will softly and suddenly vanish away
   and never be met with again

it is this it is this that oppresses my soul
   when i think of my uncles last words
and my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
   brimming over with quivering curds

it is this it is this we have had that before
   the bellman indignantly said
and the baker replied let me say it once more
   it is this it is this that i dread

i engage with the snarkevery night after dark
   in a dreamy delirious fight
i serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes
   and i use it for striking a light

but if ever i meet with a boojum that day
   in a moment of this i am sure
i shall softly and suddenly vanish away
   and the notion i cannot endure

            fit the fourth
               the hunting

the bellman looked uffish and wrinkled his brow
   if only youd spoken before
its excessively awkward to mention it now
   with the snark so to speak at the door

we should all of us grieve as you well may believe
   if you never were met with again
but surely my man when the voyage began
   you might have suggested it then

its excessively awkward to mention it now
   as i think ive already remarked
and the man they called hi replied with a sigh
   i informed you the day we embarked

you may charge me with murderor want of sense
   we are all of us weak at times
but the slightest approach to a false pretence
   was never among my crimes

i said it in hebrewi said it in dutch
   i said it in german and greek
but i wholly forgot and it vexes me much
   that english is what you speak

tis a pitiful tale said the bellman whose face
   had grown longer at every word
but now that youve stated the whole of your case
   more debate would be simply absurd

the rest of my speech he explained to his men
   you shall hear when ive leisure to speak it
but the snark is at hand let me tell you again
   tis your glorious duty to seek it

to seek it with thimbles to seek it with care
   to pursue it with forks and hope
to threaten its life with a railway share
   to charm it with smiles and soap

for the snarks a peculiar creature that wont
   be caught in a commonplace way
do all that you know and try all that you dont
   not a chance must be wasted to day

for england expectsi forbear to proceed
   tis a maxim tremendous but trite
and youd best be unpacking the things that you need
   to rig yourselves out for the fight

then the banker endorsed a blank check which he crossed
   and changed his loose silver for notes
the baker with care combed his whiskers and hair
   and shook the dust out of his coats

the boots and the broker were sharpening a spade
   each working the grindstone in turn
but the beaver went on making lace and displayed
   no interest in the concern

though the barrister tried to appeal to its pride
   and vainly proceeded to cite
a number of cases in which making laces
   had been proved an infringement of right

the maker of bonnets ferociously planned
   a novel arrangement of bows
while the billiard marker with quivering hand
   was chalking the tip of his nose

but the butcher turned nervous and dressed himself fine
   with yellow kid gloves and a ruff
said he felt it exactly like going to dine
   which the bellman declared was all stuff

introduce me now theres a good fellow he said
   if we happen to meet it together
and the bellman sagaciously nodding his head
   said that must depend on the weather

the beaver went simply galumphing about
   at seeing the butcher so shy
and even the baker though stupid and stout
   made an effort to wink with one eye

be a man said the bellman in wrath as he heard
   the butcher beginning to sob
should we meet with a jubjub that desperate bird
   we shall need all our strength for the job

             fit the fifth
               the beavers lesson

they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care
   they pursued it with forks and hope
they threatened its life with a railway share
   they charmed it with smiles and soap

then the butcher contrived an ingenious plan
   for making a separate sally
and had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man
   a dismal and desolate valley

but the very same plan to the beaver occurred
   it had chosen the very same place
yet neither betrayed by a sign or a word
   the disgust that appeared in his face

each thought he was thinking of nothing but snark
   and the glorious work of the day
and each tried to pretend that he did not remark
   that the other was going that way

but the valley grew narrow and narrower still
   and the evening got darker and colder
till merely from nervousness not from good will
   they marched along shoulder to shoulder

then a scream shrill and high rent the shuddering sky
   and they knew that some danger was near
the beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail
   and even the butcher felt queer

he thought of his childhood left far far behind
   that blissful and innocent state
the sound so exactly recalled to his mind
   a pencil that squeaks on a slate

tis the voice of the jubjub he suddenly cried
   this man that they used to call dunce
as the bellman would tell you he added with pride
   i have uttered that sentiment once

tis the note of the jubjub keep count i entreat
   you will find i have told it you twice
tis the song of the jubjub the proof is complete
   if only ive stated it thrice

the beaver had counted with scrupulous care
   attending to every word
but it fairly lost heart and outgrabe in despair
   when the third repetition occurred

it felt that in spite of all possible pains
   it had somehow contrived to lose count
and the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
   by reckoning up the amount

two added to oneif that could but be done
   it said with ones fingers and thumbs
recollecting with tears how in earlier years
   it had taken no pains with its sums

the thing can be done said the butcher i think
   the thing must be done i am sure
the thing shall be done bring me paper and ink
   the best there is time to procure

the beaver brought paper portfolio pens
   and ink in unfailing supplies
while strange creepy creatures came out of their dens
   and watched them with wondering eyes

so engrossed was the butcher he heeded them not
   as he wrote with a pen in each hand
and explained all the while in a popular style
   which the beaver could well understand

taking three as the subject to reason about
   a convenient number to state
we add seven and ten and then multiply out
   by one thousand diminished by eight

the result we proceed to divide as you see
   by nine hundred and ninety and two
then subtract seventeen and the answer must be
   exactly and perfectly true

the method employed i would gladly explain
   while i have it so clear in my head
if i had but the time and you had but the brain
   but much yet remains to be said

in one moment ive seen what has hitherto been
   enveloped in absolute mystery
and without extra charge i will give you at large
   a lesson in natural history

in his genial way he proceeded to say
   forgetting all laws of propriety
and that giving instruction without introduction
   would have caused quite a thrill in society

as to temper the jubjubs a desperate bird
   since it lives in perpetual passion
its taste in costume is entirely absurd
   it is ages ahead of the fashion

but it knows any friend it has met once before
   it never will look at a bribe
and in charity meetings it stands at the door
   and collectsthough it does not subscribe

its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far
   than mutton or oysters or eggs
some think it keeps best in an ivory jar
   and some in mahogany kegs

you boil it in sawdust you salt it in glue
   you condense it with locusts and tape
still keeping one principal object in view
   to preserve its symmetrical shape

the butcher would gladly have talked till next day
   but he felt that the lesson must end
and he wept with delight in attempting to say
   he considered the beaver his friend

while the beaver confessed with affectionate looks
   more eloquent even than tears
it had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
   would have taught it in seventy years

they returned hand in hand and the bellman unmanned
   for a moment with noble emotion
said this amply repays all the wearisome days
   we have spent on the billowy ocean

such friends as the beaver and butcher became
   have seldom if ever been known
in winter or summer twas always the same
   you could never meet either alone

and when quarrels aroseas one frequently finds
   quarrels will spite of every endeavour
the song of the jubjub recurred to their minds
   and cemented their friendship for ever

            fit the sixth
               the barristers dream

they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care
   they pursued it with forks and hope
they threatened its life with a railway share
   they charmed it with smiles and soap

but the barrister weary of proving in vain
   that the beavers lace making was wrong
fell asleep and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
   that his fancy had dwelt on so long

he dreamed that he stood in a shadowy court
   where the snark with a glass in its eye
dressed in gown bands and wig was defending a pig
   on the charge of deserting its sty

the witnesses proved without error or flaw
   that the sty was deserted when found
and the judge kept explaining the state of the law
   in a soft under current of sound

the indictment had never been clearly expressed
   and it seemed that the snark had begun
and had spoken three hours before any one guessed
   what the pig was supposed to have done

the jury had each formed a different view
   long before the indictment was read
and they all spoke at once so that none of them knew
   one word that the others had said

you must know said the judge but the snark exclaimed fudge
   that statute is obsolete quite
let me tell you my friends the whole question depends
   on an ancient manorial right

in the matter of treason the pig would appear
   to have aided but scarcely abetted
while the charge of insolvency fails it is clear
   if you grant the plea never indebted

the fact of desertion i will not dispute
   but its guilt as i trust is removed
so far as relates to the costs of this suit
   by the alibi which has been proved

my poor clients fate now depends on your votes
   here the speaker sat down in his place
and directed the judge to refer to his notes
   and briefly to sum up the case

but the judge said he never had summed up before
   so the snark undertook it instead
and summed it so well that it came to far more
   than the witnesses ever had said

when the verdict was called for the jury declined
   as the word was so puzzling to spell
but they ventured to hope that the snark wouldnt mind
   undertaking that duty as well

so the snark found the verdict although as it owned
   it was spent with the toils of the day
when it said the word guilty the jury all groaned
   and some of them fainted away

then the snark pronounced sentence the judge being quite
   too nervous to utter a word
when it rose to its feet there was silence like night
   and the fall of a pin might be heard

transportation for life was the sentence it gave
   and then to be fined forty pound
the jury all cheered though the judge said he feared
   that the phrase was not legally sound

but their wild exultation was suddenly checked
   when the jailer informed them with tears
such a sentence would have not the slightest effect
   as the pig had been dead for some years

the judge left the court looking deeply disgusted
   but the snark though a little aghast
as the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted
   went bellowing on to the last

thus the barrister dreamed while the bellowing seemed
   to grow every moment more clear
till he woke to the knell of a furious bell
   which the bellman rang close at his ear

            fit the seventh
               the bankers fate

they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care
   they pursued it with forks and hope
they threatened its life with a railway share
   they charmed it with smiles and soap

and the banker inspired with a courage so new
   it was matter for general remark
rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
   in his zeal to discover the snark

but while he was seeking with thimbles and care
   a bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
and grabbed at the banker who shrieked in despair
   for he knew it was useless to fly

he offered large discounthe offered a cheque
   drawn to bearer for seven pounds ten
but the bandersnatch merely extended its neck
   and grabbed at the banker again

without rest or pausewhile those frumious jaws
   went savagely snapping around
he skipped and he hopped and he floundered and flopped
   till fainting he fell to the ground

the bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
   led on by that fear stricken yell
and the bellman remarked it is just as i feared
   and solemnly tolled on his bell

he was black in the face and they scarcely could trace
   the least likeness to what he had been
while so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white
   a wonderful thing to be seen

to the horror of all who were present that day
   he uprose in full evening dress
and with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say
   what his tongue could no longer express

down he sank in a chairran his hands through his hair
   and chanted in mimsiest tones
words whose utter inanity proved his insanity
   while he rattled a couple of bones

leave him here to his fateit is getting so late
   the bellman exclaimed in a fright
we have lost half the day any further delay
   and we shant catch a snark before night

            fit the eighth
               the vanishing

they sought it with thimbles they sought it with care
   they pursued it with forks and hope
they threatened its life with a railway share
   they charmed it with smiles and soap

they shuddered to think that the chase might fail
   and the beaver excited at last
went bounding along on the tip of its tail
   for the daylight was nearly past

there is thingumbob shouting the bellman said
   he is shouting like mad only hark
he is waving his hands he is wagging his head
   he has certainly found a snark

they gazed in delight while the butcher exclaimed
   he was always a desperate wag
they beheld himtheir bakertheir hero unnamed
   on the top of a neighbouring crag

erect and sublime for one moment of time
   in the next that wild figure they saw
as if stung by a spasm plunge into a chasm
   while they waited and listened in awe

its a snark was the sound that first came to their ears
   and seemed almost too good to be true
then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers
   then the ominous words its a boo

then silence some fancied they heard in the air
   a weary and wandering sigh
that sounded like  jum but the others declare
   it was only a breeze that went by

they hunted till darkness came on but they found
   not a button or feather or mark
by which they could tell that they stood on the ground
   where the baker had met with the snark

in the midst of the word he was trying to say
   in the midst of his laughter and glee
he had softly and suddenly vanished away
   for the snark was a boojum you see
my mother saw the green tree toad
on the window sill
her first one
since she was young
we saw it breathe

and swell up round
my youth is no sure sign
ill find this kind of thing
tho it does sing
lets take it in

i said so grandmother can see
but she could not
it changed to brown
and town
changed us too
oh me oh life of the questions of these recurring
of the endless trains of the faithless of cities filld with the foolish
of myself forever reproaching myself for who more foolish than i and who more faithless
of eyes that vainly crave the light of the objects mean of the struggle ever renewd
