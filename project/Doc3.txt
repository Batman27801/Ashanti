for two stillborn daughters
buried out there with the carvers child

this new incandescent light makes
his evenings reading unwaveringly easy
if he remembers to wipe his spectacles
he turns to the blossoming story
of abrahams dumbstruck luck
of isaacs pure trust in his fathers wisdom
seven hundred dollars for all of her future
he shakes his head
hybridization cross breeding evolution
he takes to new theories
like a puppy takes to ice cream
we whisper that our green thumb boy
is the black mendel that darwin
would have made good use of carvers eyes
so clear his gift for observation
the best collector ive ever known
i think we have an entirely new species
of pseudocercospora
and always in his threadbare lapel
a flower even in january
ive never asked how

we had doubts
about giving him a class to teach
but hes done a bang up job
with the greenhouse his students
see the light of genius
through the dusky window of his skin
just yesterday that new boy
whats his name from arkansas
tried to raise a ruckus when carver
put his dinner tray down
he cleared his throat stared rattled
his own tray scraped his chair legs
in a rush to move away carver
ate on in silence then the boys
at the table the new boy had moved to
cleared their throats rattled their trays
and scraped their chair legs as they got up
and moved to carvers table

something about the
man does that raises the best
in you ive never asked what
i guess ill put his name next to mine
on that article im sending out
imagine a child at your door
offering to do your wash
clean your house cook
to weed your kitchen garden
or paint you a bunch of flowers
in exchange for a meal
a spindly ten year old alone
and a stranger in town here to go
to our school for colored children
his high peep brought tears
sleeping in a barn and all that
nary mama nor kin
but only white folks
he left with their blessing
his earthly belongings
in a handkerchief tied to a stick

ive brought a houseful of children
into this world concentrating on
that needles eye into eternity
but aint none of them children mine
well of course i moved him on in
he helped me with my washings
brought me roots from the woods
that bleached them white folks sheets
brighter than sunshine he could fill
a canning jar with leaves and petals
so when you lifted the lid
a fine perfume flooded your senses
white bodices and pantalettes danced
around george on my line

he was sweet with the neighbor children
taught the girls to crochet
showed the boys
a seed he said held a worm
cupped hands warmed so it wriggled and set
the seed to twitching
gave them skills and wonders
knelt with me at bedtime

he was the child the good lord gave 
and took away before i got more
than the twinkle of a glimpse
at the man he was going to be
it happened one saturday afternoon
george was holding a black eyed susan
talking about how the seed
this flower grew from
carried a message from a flower
that bloomed a million years ago
and how this flower
would send the message on
to a flower that was going to bloom
in a million more years
praise jesus ill never forget it

he left to find a teach that knew
more than he knew
i give him my bible
i keep his letters
in the bureau tied with a bow
he always sends a dried flower
at first youll joy to see the playful snow
  like white moths trembling on the tropic air
or waters of the hills that softly flow
  gracefully falling down a shining stair
 
and when the fields and streets are covered white
  and the wind worried void is chilly raw
or underneath a spell of heat and light
  the cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw
 
like me youll long for home where birds glad song
  means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry
and tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong
  beneath a vivid silver flecked blue sky
 
but oh more than the changeless southern isles
  when spring has shed upon the earth her charm
youll love the northland wreathed in golden smiles
  by the miraculous sun turned glad and warm
on sundays the preacher gives everyone a chance
to repent their sins miss edna makes me go

to church she wears a bright hat
i wear my suit babies dress in lace

girls my age some pretty some not so
pretty old ladies and men nodding

miss edna every now and then throwing her hand
in the air saying yes lord and preach

i sneak a pen from my back pocket
bend down low like i dropped something

the chorus marches up behind the preacher
clapping and humming and getting ready to sing

i write the word hope on my hand
last night this commercial came on tv it was this white lady making a nice dinner for her husband she made him some baked chicken with potatoes and gravy and some kind of greensnot collards but they still looked real good everything looked so delicious i just wanted to reach into that television and snatch a plate for myself
he gave her a kiss and then a voice came on saying hell love you for it and then the commercial went off

i sat on miss ednas scratchy couch wondering if that man and woman really ate that food or just threw it all away

now ms marcus wants to know why i wrote that the lady is white and i say because its true and ms marcus says lonnie what does race have to do with it forgetting that she asked us to use lots of details when we wrote forgetting that whole long talk she gave yesterday about the importance of description i dont say anything back to her just look down at my arm its dark brown and theres a scab by my wrist that i dont pick at if i remember not to i look at my knuckles theyre real dark too

outside its starting to rain and the way the rain comes downtap tapping against the windowgets me to thinking ms marcus dont understand some things even though shes my favorite teacher in the world things like my brown brown arm and the white lady and man with all that good food to throw away how if you turn on your tv thats what you seepeople with lots and lots of stuff not having to sit on scratchy couches in miss ednas house and the true fact is alotta those people are white maybe its that if youre white you cant see all the whiteness around you
the monsters that come at night dont
breathe fire have two heads or long claws

the monsters that come at night dont
come bloody and half dead and calling your name

they come looking like regular boys
going through your drawers and pockets saying

you better not tell counselor else ill beat you down
the monsters that come at night snatch

the covers off your bed take your
pillow and in the morning

steal your bacon when the cooks back is turned
call themselves the throwaway boys say

you one of us now
when the relatives stop coming

when you dont know where your sister is anymore
when every sign around you says

group home rules dont
do this and dont do that

until it sinks in one rainy saturday afternoon
while youre sitting at the group home window

reading a beat up group home book
wearing a group home hand me down shirt

hearing all the group home loudness that
you are a throwaway boy

and the news just sits in your stomach
hard and heavy as group home food

ms marcus says that an occasional poem is a poem
written about something
important
or special
thats gonna happen
or already did
think of a specific occasion she saysand write about it

like what lamont asks
hes all slouched down in his seat
i dont feel like writing about no occasion

how about your birthday ms marcus says
what about it just a birthday comes in june and it aint
june lamont says as a matter of fact
he says its january and its snowing
then his voice gets real low and he says
and when its january and all cold like this
feels like junes a long long ways away

the whole class looks at ms marcus
some of the kids are nodding
outside the sky looks like its made out of metal
and the cold cold air is rattling the windowpanes
and coming underneath them too

i seen lamonts coat
its gray and the sleeves are too short
its down but it looks like a lot of the feathers fell out
a long time ago
ms marcus got a nice coat
its down too but real puffy so
maybe when shes inside it
she cant even tell january from june

then write about january ms marcus says thats
an occasion
but she looks a little bit sad when she says it
like shes sorry she ever brought the whole
occasional poem thing up

i was gonna write about mamas funeral
but lamont and ms marcus going back and forth
zapped all the ideas from my head

i guess them arguing
on a tuesday in januarys an occasion
so i guess this is an occasional poem
when people ask how i say
a fire took them
and then they look at me like
im the most pitiful thing in the world
so sometimes i just shrug and say
they just died thats all

a fire took their bodies
thats all

i can still feel their voices and hugs and laughing
sometimes
sometimes i can hear my daddy
calling my name
lonnie sometimes
and sometimes locomotion
come on over here a minute
i want to show you something

and then i see his big hands
holding something out to me

it used to be the four of us
at night we went to sleep
in the morning we woke up and ate breakfast
daddy worked for con edison
you ever saw him
climbing out of a manhole
yellow tape keeping the cars from coming
down the block
an orange sign that said men working
i still got his hat its light blue
with con edison in white letters

mama was a receptionist
when you called the office where she worked
she answered the phone like this
graftman paper products how may i help you
it was her work voice
and when you said something like
ma its me
her voice went back to normal to our mamas voice
hey sugar you behaving is the door locked

that stupid fire couldnt take all of them
nothing could do that

nothing
when the kids in my class ask why
i am not allowed to pledge to the flag
i tell them its against my religion but dont say
i am in the world but not of the world this
they would not understand
even though my mothers not a jehovahs witness
she makes us follow their rules and
leave the classroom when the pledge is being said

every morning i walk out with gina and alina
the two other witnesses in my class
sometimes gina says
maybe we should pray for the kids inside
who dont know that god said
no other idols before me that our god
is a jealous god
gina is a true believer her bible open
during reading time but alina and i walk through
our roles as witnesses as though this is the part
weve been given in a play
and once offstage we run free sing
america the beautiful and the star spangled banner
far away from our familiesknowing every word

alina and i want
more than anything to walk back into our classroom
press our hands against our hearts say
i pledge allegiance    loud
without our jealous god looking down on us
     without our parents finding out
without our mothers voices
in our heads saying you are different
chosen
good

when the pledge is over we walk single file
back into the classroom take our separate seats
alina and i far away from gina but gina
always looks back at usas if to say
im watching you as if to say
i know
no one was faster
than my father on the football field
no one could keep him
from crossing the line then
touching down again
coaches were watching the way he moved
his easy stride his long arms reaching
up snatching the ball from its soft pockets
of air

my father dreamed football dreams
and woke up to a scholarship
at ohio state university
grown now
living the big city life
in columbus
just sixty miles
from nelsonville
and from there
interstate  could get you
on your way west to chicago
interstate  could take you south
but my father said
no colored buckeye in his right mind
would ever want to go there

from columbus my father said
you could go just about
anywhere

my mother has a gap between
her two front teeth so does daddy gunnar
each child in this family has the same space
connecting us

our baby brother roman was born pale as dust
his soft brown curls and eyelashes stop
people on the street
whose angel child is this they want to know
when i say my brother the people
wear doubt
thick as a cape
until we smile
and the cape falls
good enough name for me my father said
the day i was born
dont see why
she cant have it too

but the women said no
my mother first
then each aunt pulling my pink blanket back
patting the crop of thick curls
tugging at my new toes
touching my cheeks

we wont have a girl named jack my mother said

and my fathers sisters whispered
a boy named jack was bad enough
but only so my mother could hear
name a girl jack my father said
and she cant help but
grow up strong
raise her right my father said
and shell make that name her own
name a girl jack
and people will look at her twice my father said

for no good reason but to ask if her parents
were crazy my mother said

and back and forth it went until i was jackie
and my father left the hospital mad

my mother said to my aunts
hand me that pen wrote
jacqueline where it asked for a name
jacqueline just in case
someone thought to drop the ie

jacqueline  just in case
i grew up and wanted something a little bit longer
and further away from
jack
my mother says

when mama tried to teach me

to make collards and potato salad
i didnt want to learn

she opens the box of pancake mix adds milk
and eggs stirs i watch
grateful for the food we have nowsyrup waiting
in the cabinet bananas to slice on top
its saturday morning
five days a week she leaves us
to work at an office back in brownsville
saturday we have her to ourselves all day long

me and kay didnt want to be inside cooking

she stirs the lumps from the batter pours it
into the buttered hissing pan

wanted to be with our friends
running wild through greenville
there was a man with a peach tree down the road
one day robert climbed over that fence filled a bucket
with peaches wouldnt share them with any of us but
told us where the peach tree was and thats where we
wanted to be
sneaking peaches from that mans tree throwing
the rotten ones
at your uncles

mama wanted us to learn to cook

ask the boys we said and mama knew that wasnt fair
girls inside and the boys going off to steal peaches
so she let all of us
stay outside until suppertime

and by then she says putting our breakfast on the table

it was too late
the first time i write my full name

jacqueline amanda woodson

without anybodys help
on a clean white page in my composition notebook
     i know

if i wanted to

i could write anything

letters becoming words words gathering meaning
     becoming
thoughts outside my head

becoming sentences

the first time my brother says aint my mother
pulls a branch from the willow tree growing down
the hill at the edge
of our backyard
as she slips her closed hand over it
removes the leaves
my brother begins to cry
because the branch is a switch now

no longer beautifully weeping at the bottom of the hill
it whirs as my mother whips it
through the air and down
against my brothers legs

you will never my mother says
say aint in this house
you will never
say aint anywhere

each switching is a warning to us
our words are to remain
