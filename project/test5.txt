    but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token
    and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore
this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore
            merely this and nothing more

    back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning
soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before
    surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice
      let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore
let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
            tis the wind and nothing more

    open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter
in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
    not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he
    but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door
perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door
            perched and sat and nothing more

then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore
tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore
            quoth the raven nevermore

    much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore
    for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
    ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
            with such name as nevermore

    but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only
that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
    nothing farther then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered
    till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before
on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before
            then the bird said nevermore

    startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store
    caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
    followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
            of nevernevermore

    but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling
straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door
    then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking
    fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore
what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore
            meant in croaking nevermore

    this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing
to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
    this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining
    on the cushions velvet lining that the lamp light gloated oer
but whose velvet violet lining with the lamp light gloating oer
            she shall press ah nevermore

    then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer
swung by seraphim whose foot falls tinkled on the tufted floor
    wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee
    respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore
quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore
            quoth the raven nevermore

    prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil
whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
    desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted
    on this home by horror hauntedtell me truly i implore
is thereis there balm in gileadtell metell me i implore
            quoth the raven nevermore

    prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil
by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore
    tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn
    it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
            quoth the raven nevermore

    be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting
get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore
    leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
    leave my loneliness unbrokenquit the bust above my door
take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
            quoth the raven nevermore

    and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
    and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming
    and the lamp light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
            shall be liftednevermore

so much depends
upon

a red wheel
barrow

glazed with rain
water

beside the white
chickens
today we woke up to a revolution of snow   
its white flag waving over everything
the landscape vanished
not a single mouse to punctuate the blankness   
and beyond these windows

the government buildings smothered
schools and libraries buried the post office lost   
under the noiseless drift
the paths of trains softly blocked
the world fallen under this falling

in a while i will put on some boots
and step out like someone walking in water   
and the dog will porpoise through the drifts   
and i will shake a laden branch
sending a cold shower down on us both

but for now i am a willing prisoner in this house   
a sympathizer with the anarchic cause of snow   
i will make a pot of tea
and listen to the plastic radio on the counter   
as glad as anyone to hear the news

that the kiddie corner school is closed   
the ding dong school closed
the all aboard childrens school closed   
the hi ho nursery school closed
along withsome will be delighted to hear

the toadstool school the little school
little sparrows nursery school
little stars pre school peas and carrots day school   
the tom thumb child center all closed
andclap your handsthe peanuts play school

so this is where the children hide all day
these are the nests where they letter and draw   
where they put on their bright miniature jackets   
all darting and climbing and sliding
all but the few girls whispering by the fence

and now i am listening hard
in the grandiose silence of the snow
trying to hear what those three girls are plotting   
what riot is afoot
which small queen is about to be brought down
i know what the caged bird feels alas
    when the sun is bright on the upland slopes   
when the wind stirs soft through the springing grass   
and the river flows like a stream of glass
    when the first bird sings and the first bud opes   
and the faint perfume from its chalice steals
i know what the caged bird feels

i know why the caged bird beats his wing
    till its blood is red on the cruel bars   
for he must fly back to his perch and cling   
when he fain would be on the bough a swing
    and a pain still throbs in the old old scars   
and they pulse again with a keener sting
i know why he beats his wing

i know why the caged bird sings ah me
    when his wing is bruised and his bosom sore
when he beats his bars and he would be free
it is not a carol of joy or glee
    but a prayer that he sends from his hearts deep core   
but a plea that upward to heaven he flings
i know why the caged bird sings
then was the grown up world of tall decision
its beauty of late nights denied a child
world of bewildering gifts and strange derision
alien alike whether it frowned or smiled
yet your least wish was governed by its laws
the landscape and the weather both were odd
exploding with effects that hid a cause
serene and lonely as the will of god
recall it peopled by an august race
immune to the passions that attack the young
and knowing all there every commonplace
must be translated from a marvellous tongue

now is the world of grandeur dwindled shrunk
to what the stupidest can understand
the shabby treasures of an exiles trunk
include no passport to that wonderland
though you are told you are a citizen
the scenery is changed the climate dull
the fateful masks are faces gods are men
most nights are long and few are magical
but there are strangers even here their speech
is rich in barbarous mystery their ways
are private who live wholly beyond reach
admired and feared though none of us obeys
their foreign rule no dictators and yet
strong utterly while we with pity wrung
for what they must do suffer learn forget
feel shy when we approach them they are young

among twenty snowy mountains   
the only moving thing   
was the eye of the blackbird   

i was of three minds   
like a tree   
in which there are three blackbirds   

the blackbird whirled in the autumn winds   
it was a small part of the pantomime   

a man and a woman   
are one   
a man and a woman and a blackbird   
are one   

i do not know which to prefer   
the beauty of inflections   
or the beauty of innuendoes   
the blackbird whistling   
or just after   

icicles filled the long window   
with barbaric glass   
the shadow of the blackbird   
crossed it to and fro   
the mood   
traced in the shadow   
an indecipherable cause   

o thin men of haddam   
why do you imagine golden birds   
do you not see how the blackbird   
walks around the feet   
of the women about you   

i know noble accents   
and lucid inescapable rhythms   
but i know too   
that the blackbird is involved   
in what i know   

when the blackbird flew out of sight   
it marked the edge   
of one of many circles   

at the sight of blackbirds   
flying in a green light   
even the bawds of euphony   
would cry out sharply   

he rode over connecticut   
in a glass coach   
once a fear pierced him   
in that he mistook   
the shadow of his equipage   
for blackbirds   

the river is moving   
the blackbird must be flying   

it was evening all afternoon   
it was snowing   
and it was going to snow   
the blackbird sat   
in the cedar limbs

the time you won your town the race
we chaired you through the market place
man and boy stood cheering by
and home we brought you shoulder high

today the road all runners come
shoulder high we bring you home
and set you at your threshold down
townsman of a stiller town

smart lad to slip betimes away
from fields where glory does not stay
and early though the laurel grows
it withers quicker than the rose

eyes the shady night has shut
cannot see the record cut
and silence sounds no worse than cheers
after earth has stopped the ears

now you will not swell the rout
of lads that wore their honours out
runners whom renown outran
and the name died before the man

so set before its echoes fade
the fleet foot on the sill of shade
and hold to the low lintel up
the still defended challenge cup

and round that early laurelled head
will flock to gaze the strengthless dead
and find unwithered on its curls
the garland briefer than a girls
like a monstrous snail a toilet slides into a living room on a track of wet demanding to be loved
         it is impossible and we tender our sincerest regrets in the book of the heart there is no mention made of plumbing
         and though we have spent our intimacy many times with you you belong to an unfortunate reference which we would rather not embrace 
         the toilet slides away 


do you have adequate oxen for the job
no my oxen are inadequate
well how many oxen would it take to do an adequate job
i would need ten more oxen to do the job adequately
ill see if i can get them for you
id be obliged if you could do that for me
certainly and do you have sufficient fishcakes for the men
we have fifty fishcakes which is less than sufficient
ill have them delivered on the morrow
do you need maps of the mountains and the underworld
we have maps of the mountains but we lack maps of the underworld
of course you lack maps of the underworld
there are no maps of the underworld
and besides you dont want to go there its stuffy
i had no intention of going there or anywhere for that matter
its just that you asked me if i needed maps   
yes yes its my fault i got carried away
what do you need then you tell me
we need seeds we need plows we need scythes chickens
pigs cows buckets and women
women
we have no women
youre a sorry lot then
we are a sorry lot sir
well i cant get you women
i assumed as much sir
what are you going to do without women then
we will suffer sir and then well die out one by one
can any of you sing
yes sir we have many fine singers among us
order them to begin singing immediately
either women will find you this way or you will die
comforted meanwhile busy yourselves
with the meaningful tasks you have set for yourselves
sir we will not rest until the babes arrive
the apparition of these faces in the crowd
petals on a wet black bough

where all the trees bear golden flowers
   and all the birds are white
where fairy folk in dancing hours
   burn stars for candlelight

where every wind and leaf can talk
   but no man understand
save one whose child feet chanced to walk
   green paths of fairyland

i followed two swift silver wings
   i stalked a roving song
i startled shining silent things
   i wandered all day long

but when it seemed the shadowy hours
   whispered of soft foot night
i crept home to sweet common flowers
   brown birds and candlelight
it was many and many a year ago
   in a kingdom by the sea
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
   by the name of annabel lee
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
   than to love and be loved by me

i was a child and she was a child
   in this kingdom by the sea
but we loved with a love that was more than love
   i and my annabel lee
with a love that the wingd seraphs of heaven
   coveted her and me

and this was the reason that long ago
   in this kingdom by the sea
a wind blew out of a cloud chilling
   my beautiful annabel lee
so that her highborn kinsmen came
   and bore her away from me
to shut her up in a sepulchre
   in this kingdom by the sea

the angels not half so happy in heaven
   went envying her and me
yesthat was the reason as all men know
   in this kingdom by the sea
that the wind came out of the cloud by night
   chilling and killing my annabel lee

but our love it was stronger by far than the love
   of those who were older than we
   of many far wiser than we
and neither the angels in heaven above
   nor the demons down under the sea
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
   of the beautiful annabel lee

for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
   of the beautiful annabel lee
and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes
   of the beautiful annabel lee
and so all the night tide i lie down by the side
   of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride
   in her sepulchre there by the sea
   in her tomb by the sounding sea

just off the highway to rochester minnesota
twilight bounds softly forth on the grass
and the eyes of those two indian ponies
darken with kindness
they have come gladly out of the willows
to welcome my friend and me
we step over the barbed wire into the pasture
where they have been grazing all day alone
they ripple tensely they can hardly contain their happiness   
that we have come
they bow shyly as wet swans they love each other
there is no loneliness like theirs   
at home once more
they begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness   
i would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms
for she has walked over to me   
and nuzzled my left hand   
she is black and white
her mane falls wild on her forehead
and the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear
that is delicate as the skin over a girls wrist
suddenly i realize
that if i stepped out of my body i would break
into blossom
half a league half a league
half a league onward
all in the valley of death
   rode the six hundred
forward the light brigade
charge for the guns he said
into the valley of death
   rode the six hundred
forward the light brigade
was there a man dismayed
not though the soldier knew
   someone had blundered
   theirs not to make reply
   theirs not to reason why
   theirs but to do and die
   into the valley of death
   rode the six hundred
cannon to right of them
cannon to left of them
cannon in front of them
   volleyed and thundered
stormed at with shot and shell
boldly they rode and well
into the jaws of death
into the mouth of hell
   rode the six hundred
flashed all their sabres bare
flashed as they turned in air
sabring the gunners there
charging an army while
   all the world wondered
plunged in the battery smoke
right through the line they broke
cossack and russian
reeled from the sabre stroke
   shattered and sundered
then they rode back but not
   not the six hundred
cannon to right of them
cannon to left of them
cannon behind them
   volleyed and thundered
stormed at with shot and shell
while horse and hero fell
they that had fought so well
came through the jaws of death
back from the mouth of hell
all that was left of them
   left of six hundred
when can their glory fade
o the wild charge they made
   all the world wondered
honour the charge they made
honour the light brigade
   noble six hundred

by the rude bridge that arched the flood
   their flag to aprils breeze unfurled
here once the embattled farmers stood
   and fired the shot heard round the world

the foe long since in silence slept
   alike the conqueror silent sleeps
and time the ruined bridge has swept
   down the dark stream which seaward creeps

on this green bank by this soft stream
   we set today a votive stone
that memory may their deed redeem
   when like our sires our sons are gone

spirit that made those heroes dare
   to die and leave their children free
bid time and nature gently spare
   the shaft we raise to them and thee
there are strange things done in the midnight sun
      by the men who moil for gold
the arctic trails have their secret tales
      that would make your blood run cold
the northern lights have seen queer sights
      but the queerest they ever did see
was that night on the marge of lake lebarge
      i cremated sam mcgee

now sam mcgee was from tennessee where the cotton blooms and blows
why he left his home in the south to roam round the pole god only knows
he was always cold but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell
though hed often say in his homely way that hed sooner live in hell

on a christmas day we were mushing our way over the dawson trail
talk of your cold through the parkas fold it stabbed like a driven nail
if our eyes wed close then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldnt see
it wasnt much fun but the only one to whimper was sam mcgee

and that very night as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow
and the dogs were fed and the stars oerhead were dancing heel and toe
he turned to me and cap says he ill cash in this trip i guess
and if i do im asking that you wont refuse my last request

well he seemed so low that i couldnt say no then he says with a sort of moan
its the cursd cold and its got right hold till im chilled clean through to the bone
yet taint being deadits my awful dread of the icy grave that pains
so i want you to swear that foul or fair youll cremate my last remains

a pals last need is a thing to heed so i swore i would not fail
and we started on at the streak of dawn but god he looked ghastly pale
he crouched on the sleigh and he raved all day of his home in tennessee
and before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of sam mcgee

there wasnt a breath in that land of death and i hurried horror driven
with a corpse half hid that i couldnt get rid because of a promise given
it was lashed to the sleigh and it seemed to say you may tax your brawn and brains
but you promised true and its up to you to cremate those last remains

now a promise made is a debt unpaid and the trail has its own stern code
in the days to come though my lips were dumb in my heart how i cursed that load
in the long long night by the lone firelight while the huskies round in a ring
howled out their woes to the homeless snows o god how i loathed the thing

and every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow
and on i went though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low
the trail was bad and i felt half mad but i swore i would not give in
and id often sing to the hateful thing and it hearkened with a grin

till i came to the marge of lake lebarge and a derelict there lay
it was jammed in the ice but i saw in a trice it was called the alice may
and i looked at it and i thought a bit and i looked at my frozen chum
then here said i with a sudden cry is my cre ma tor eum

some planks i tore from the cabin floor and i lit the boiler fire
some coal i found that was lying around and i heaped the fuel higher
the flames just soared and the furnace roaredsuch a blaze you seldom see
and i burrowed a hole in the glowing coal and i stuffed in sam mcgee

then i made a hike for i didnt like to hear him sizzle so
and the heavens scowled and the huskies howled and the wind began to blow
it was icy cold but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks and i dont know why
and the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky

i do not know how long in the snow i wrestled with grisly fear
but the stars came out and they danced about ere again i ventured near
i was sick with dread but i bravely said ill just take a peep inside
i guess hes cooked and its time i looked  then the door i opened wide

and there sat sam looking cool and calm in the heart of the furnace roar
and he wore a smile you could see a mile and he said please close that door
its fine in here but i greatly fear youll let in the cold and storm
since i left plumtree down in tennessee its the first time ive been warm

there are strange things done in the midnight sun
      by the men who moil for gold
the arctic trails have their secret tales
      that would make your blood run cold
the northern lights have seen queer sights
      but the queerest they ever did see
was that night on the marge of lake lebarge
      i cremated sam mcgee
the way a crow
shook down on me
the dust of snow
from a hemlock tree

has given my heart
a change of mood
and saved some part
of a day i had rued
in the steamer is the trout   
seasoned with slivers of ginger
two sprigs of green onion and sesame oil   
we shall eat it with rice for lunch   
brothers sister my mother who will   
taste the sweetest meat of the head   
holding it between her fingers   
deftly the way my father did   
weeks ago then he lay down   
to sleep like a snow covered road   
winding through pines older than him   
without any travelers and lonely for no one
my black face fades   
hiding inside the black granite   
i said i wouldnt  
dammit no tears   
im stone im flesh   
my clouded reflection eyes me   
like a bird of prey the profile of night   
slanted against morning i turn   
this waythe stone lets me go   
i turn that wayim inside   
the vietnam veterans memorial
again depending on the light   
to make a difference   
i go down the  names   
half expecting to find   
my own in letters like smoke   
i touch the name andrew johnson   
i see the booby traps white flash   
names shimmer on a womans blouse   
but when she walks away   
the names stay on the wall   
brushstrokes flash a red birds   
wings cutting across my stare   
the sky a plane in the sky   
a white vets image floats   
closer to me then his pale eyes   
look through mine im a window   
hes lost his right arm   
inside the stone in the black mirror   
a womans trying to erase names   
no shes brushing a boys hair
through the night   
the apples
outside my window   
one by one let go   
their branches and   
drop to the lawn
i cant see but hear
the stem snap the plummet
through leaves then
the final thump against the ground

sometimes two   
at once or one   
right after another
during long moments of silence
i wait
and wonder about the bruised bodies   
the terror of diving through air and   
think ill go tomorrow
to find the newly fallen but they
all look alike lying there
dewsoaked disappearing before me
i lie beneath my window listening   
to the sound of apples dropping in

the yard a syncopated code i long to know
which continues even as i sleep and dream i know

the meaning of what i hear each dull   
thud of unseen apple 

body the earth   
falling to earth

once and forever over   
and over
the world is charged with the grandeur of god
    it will flame out like shining from shook foil
    it gathers to a greatness like the ooze of oil
crushed why do men then now not reck his rod
generations have trod have trod have trod
    and all is seared with trade bleared smeared with toil
    and wears mans smudge and shares mans smell the soil
is bare now nor can foot feel being shod

and for all this nature is never spent
    there lives the dearest freshness deep down things
and though the last lights off the black west went
    oh morning at the brown brink eastward springs 
because the holy ghost over the bent
    world broods with warm breast and with ah bright wings
i am fourteen
and my skin has betrayed me   
the boy i cannot live without   
still sucks his thumb
in secret
how come my knees are
always so ashy
what if i die
before morning
and mommas in the bedroom   
with the door closed

i have to learn how to dance   
in time for the next party   
my room is too small for me   
suppose i die before graduation   
they will sing sad melodies   
but finally
tell the truth about me
there is nothing i want to do   
and too much
that has to be done
and mommas in the bedroom   
with the door closed

nobody even stops to think   
about my side of it
i should have been on math team   
my marks were better than his   
why do i have to be
the one
wearing braces
i have nothing to wear tomorrow   
will i live long enough
to grow up
and mommas in the bedroom   
with the door closed

the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees   
the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas   
the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor   
and the highwayman came riding
         ridingriding
the highwayman came riding up to the old inn door

hed a french cocked hat on his forehead a bunch of lace at his chin   
a coat of the claret velvet and breeches of brown doe skin
they fitted with never a wrinkle his boots were up to the thigh   
and he rode with a jewelled twinkle
         his pistol butts a twinkle
his rapier hilt a twinkle under the jewelled sky

over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn yard
he tapped with his whip on the shutters but all was locked and barred   
he whistled a tune to the window and who should be waiting there   
but the landlords black eyed daughter
         bess the landlords daughter
plaiting a dark red love knot into her long black hair

and dark in the dark old inn yard a stable wicket creaked
where tim the ostler listened his face was white and peaked   
his eyes were hollows of madness his hair like mouldy hay   
but he loved the landlords daughter
         the landlords red lipped daughter
dumb as a dog he listened and he heard the robber say

one kiss my bonny sweetheart im after a prize to night
but i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light
yet if they press me sharply and harry me through the day   
then look for me by moonlight
         watch for me by moonlight
ill come to thee by moonlight though hell should bar the way

he rose upright in the stirrups he scarce could reach her hand
but she loosened her hair in the casement his face burnt like a brand
as the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast   
and he kissed its waves in the moonlight
         o sweet black waves in the moonlight
then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight and galloped away to the west

he did not come in the dawning he did not come at noon   
and out of the tawny sunset before the rise of the moon   
when the road was a gypsys ribbon looping the purple moor   
a red coat troop came marching
         marchingmarching
king georges men came marching up to the old inn door

they said no word to the landlord they drank his ale instead   
but they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed
two of them knelt at her casement with muskets at their side   
there was death at every window
         and hell at one dark window
for bess could see through her casement the road that he would ride

they had tied her up to attention with many a sniggering jest
they had bound a musket beside her with the muzzle beneath her breast
now keep good watch and they kissed her she heard the doomed man say
look for me by moonlight
         watch for me by moonlight
ill come to thee by moonlight though hell should bar the way

she twisted her hands behind her but all the knots held good
she writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood   
they stretched and strained in the darkness and the hours crawled by like years
till now on the stroke of midnight
         cold on the stroke of midnight
the tip of one finger touched it the trigger at least was hers

the tip of one finger touched it she strove no more for the rest   
up she stood up to attention with the muzzle beneath her breast   
she would not risk their hearing she would not strive again   
for the road lay bare in the moonlight
         blank and bare in the moonlight
and the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her loves refrain

tlot tlot tlot tlot had they heard it the horsehoofs ringing clear   
tlot tlot tlot tlot in the distance were they deaf that they did not hear
down the ribbon of moonlight over the brow of the hill
the highwayman came riding
         ridingriding
the red coats looked to their priming she stood up straight and still

tlot tlot in the frosty silence tlot tlot in the echoing night   
nearer he came and nearer her face was like a light
her eyes grew wide for a moment she drew one last deep breath   
then her finger moved in the moonlight
         her musket shattered the moonlight
shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned himwith her death

he turned he spurred to the west he did not know who stood   
bowed with her head oer the musket drenched with her own blood   
not till the dawn he heard it and his face grew grey to hear   
how bess the landlords daughter
         the landlords black eyed daughter
had watched for her love in the moonlight and died in the darkness there

back he spurred like a madman shrieking a curse to the sky
with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high
blood red were his spurs in the golden noon wine red was his velvet coat
when they shot him down on the highway
         down like a dog on the highway
and he lay in his blood on the highway with a bunch of lace at his throat
and still of a winters night they say when the wind is in the trees
when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas   
when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor   
a highwayman comes riding
         ridingriding
a highwayman comes riding up to the old inn door

over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn yard
he taps with his whip on the shutters but all is locked and barred   
he whistles a tune to the window and who should be waiting there   
but the landlords black eyed daughter
         bess the landlords daughter
plaiting a dark red love knot into her long black hair
hope is the thing with feathers  
that perches in the soul  
and sings the tune without the words  
and never stops   at all  

and sweetest   in the gale   is heard  
and sore must be the storm  
that could abash the little bird
that kept so many warm  

ive heard it in the chillest land  
and on the strangest sea  
yet   never   in extremity
it asked a crumb   of me
if we must die let it not be like hogs
hunted and penned in an inglorious spot
while round us bark the mad and hungry dogs
making their mock at our accursd lot
if we must die o let us nobly die
so that our precious blood may not be shed
in vain then even the monsters we defy
shall be constrained to honor us though dead
o kinsmen we must meet the common foe
though far outnumbered let us show us brave
and for their thousand blows deal one death blow
what though before us lies the open grave
like men well face the murderous cowardly pack
pressed to the wall dying but fighting back

in just 
spring          when the world is mud 
luscious the little
lame balloonman

whistles          far          and wee

and eddieandbill come
running from marbles and
piracies and its
spring

when the world is puddle wonderful

the queer
old balloonman whistles
far          and             wee
and bettyandisbel come dancing

from hop scotch and jump rope and

its
spring
and

         the

                  goat footed

balloonman          whistles
far
and
wee
we are things of dry hours and the involuntary plan
grayed in and gray dream makes a giddy sound not strong
like rent feeding a wife satisfying a man

but could a dream send up through onion fumes
its white and violet fight with fried potatoes
and yesterdays garbage ripening in the hall
flutter or sing an aria down these rooms

even if we were willing to let it in
had time to warm it keep it very clean
anticipate a message let it begin

we wonder but not well not for a minute
since number five is out of the bathroom now
we think of lukewarm water hope to get in it
i will arise and go now and go to innisfree
and a small cabin build there of clay and wattles made
nine bean rows will i have there a hive for the honey bee
and live alone in the bee loud glade

and i shall have some peace there for peace comes dropping slow
dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings
there midnights all a glimmer and noon a purple glow
and evening full of the linnets wings

i will arise and go now for always night and day
i hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore
while i stand on the roadway or on the pavements grey
i hear it in the deep hearts core

little lamb who made thee 
         dost thou know who made thee 
gave thee life  bid thee feed 
by the stream  oer the mead
gave thee clothing of delight
softest clothing wooly bright
gave thee such a tender voice
making all the vales rejoice 
         little lamb who made thee 
         dost thou know who made thee 

         little lamb ill tell thee
         little lamb ill tell thee
he is called by thy name
for he calls himself a lamb 
he is meek  he is mild 
he became a little child 
i a child  thou a lamb 
we are called by his name
         little lamb god bless thee 
         little lamb god bless thee

when liberty is headlong girl
and runs her roads and wends her ways
liberty will shriek and whirl
her showery torch to see it blaze

when liberty is wedded wife
and keeps the barn and counts the byre
liberty amends her life
she drowns her torch for fear of fire

light the first of eight tonight
the farthest candle to the right

light the first and second too
when tomorrows day is through

then light three and then light four
every dusk one candle more

till all eight burn bright and high
honoring a day gone by

when the temple was restored
rescued from the syrian lord

and an eight day feast proclaimed
the festival of lightswell named
