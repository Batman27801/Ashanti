of the poor results of all of the plodding and sordid crowds i see around me
of the empty and useless years of the rest with the rest me intertwined
the question o me so sad recurringwhat good amid these o me o life
there is no frigate like a book
to take us lands away
nor any coursers like a page
of prancing poetry 
this traverse may the poorest take
without oppress of toll 
how frugal is the chariot
that bears the human soul 
the room i entered was a dream of this room
surely all those feet on the sofa were mine
the oval portrait
of a dog was me at an early age
something shimmers something is hushed up

we had macaroni for lunch every day
except sunday when a small quail was induced
to be served to us why do i tell you these things
you are not even here

every few minutes he wants
to march the trail of flattened rye grass
back to the house of muttering
hens he too could make
a bed in hay yesterday the egg so fresh
it felt hot in his hand and he pressed it
to his ear while the other children
laughed and ran with a ball leaving him
so little yet too forgetful in games
ready to cry if the ball brushed him
riveted to the secret of birds
caught up inside his fist
not ready to give it over
to the refrigerator
or the rest of the day

what the scale tells you is how much the earth
has missed you body how it wants you back
again after you leave it to go forth

into the light do you remember how
earth hardly noticed you then others would rock
you in their arms warm in the flow

that fed you coaxed you upright then earth began
to claim you with spots and fevers began to lick
at you with a bruised knee a bloody shin

and finally to stoke you body drumming
intimate coded messages through music
you danced to unawares there in your dreaming

and your poems and your obedient blood
body how useful you became how lucky
heavy with news and breakage rich and sad

sometimes imagining that greedy zero
you must have been that promising empty sack
of possibilities never to come tomorrow

but look at you now body soft old shoe
that love wears when its stirring look down look
how earth wants what you weigh needs what you know
my mothers mother widowed very young
of her first love and of that loves first fruit
moved through her fathers farm her country tongue
and country heart anaesthetized and mute
with labor so her kind was taught to do
find work she would reply to every grief
and her one dictum whether false or true
tolled heavy with her passionate belief
widowed again with children in her prime
she spoke so little it was hard to bear
so much composure such a truce with time
spent in the lifelong practice of despair
but i recall her floors scrubbed white as bone
her dishes and how painfully they shone
the turtle carries his house on his back he is both the house and the person of that house
         but actually under the shell is a little room where the true turtle wearing long underwear sits at a little table at one end of the room a series of levers sticks out of slots in the floor like the controls of a steam shovel it is with these that the turtle controls the legs of his house
         most of the time the turtle sits under the sloping ceiling of his turtle room reading catalogues at the little table where a candle burns he leans on one elbow and then the other he crosses one leg and then the other finally he yawns and buries his head in his arms and sleeps
         if he feels a child picking up his house he quickly douses the candle and runs to the control levers and activates the legs of his house and tries to escape
         if he cannot escape he retracts the legs and withdraws the so called head and waits he knows that children are careless and that there will come a time when he will be free to move his house to some secluded place where he will relight his candle take out his catalogues and read until at last he yawns then hell bury his head in his arms and sleepthat is until another child picks up his house
n the american schoolyard
where we lunged headfirst
onto the rocky ground scrab 
bling for a ball
                         as if
for love the crossed chalk 
line still electrified our
tough boyish hearts and no
one much cared
                      for such
exotic gods as loomed up
out of the palatine hills
in the required guidebooks
dumped in heaps
                        behind our
makeshift goal we knew
what we knew sweatstains
darkened our blue school
shirts while
                   our fathers
fighters strafed the mock 
ups in the practice fields
never far enough from town
it didnt thunder
                           all day
through the blackened
cottages stony stares locked
up tight behind their shot
bolts nor through
                            the evening
either when drifting home
stripped to the waist wed
dance feet chalked across
the marketplace
                        like young
uneasy gods a little drunk
on our shame our power
we pull off
to a road shack
in massachusetts
to watch men walk

on the moon we did   
the same thing
for three two one
blast off and now

we watch the same men   
bounce in and out
of craters i want
a coke and a hamburger

because the men
are walking on the moon   
which is now irrefutably   
not green not cheese

not a shiny dime floating   
in a cold blue
the way id thought
the road shack people dont

notice we are a black   
family not from there   
the way it mostly goes   
this talking through

static bounces in space 
boots tethered   
to cords is much   
stranger stranger

even than we are

the bison is vain and i write it with pain
   the door mat you see on his head
is not as some learned professors maintain   
the opulent growth of a genius brain
   but is sewn on with needle and thread

you could drive blind
for those two seconds
and they would be forever
i think that as a diesel truck
passes us eight miles east of mission
churning through the storm heedless
of the hill sliding away
there isnt much use to curse but i do
words fly away tumbling invisibly
toward the unseen point where
the prairie and sky meet
the road is like that in those seconds
nothing but the blind white side
of creation

                   youre there somewhere
a tiny struggling cell
you just might be significant
but you might not be anything
forever is a space of split time
from which to recover after the mass passes
my curse flies out there somewhere
and then i send my prayer into the wake
of the diesel truck headed for sioux falls
one hundred and eighty miles through the storm
a free bird leaps
on the back of the wind   
and floats downstream   
till the current ends
and dips his wing
in the orange sun rays
and dares to claim the sky

but a bird that stalks
down his narrow cage
can seldom see through
his bars of rage
his wings are clipped and   
his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing

the caged bird sings   
with a fearful trill   
of things unknown   
but longed for still   
and his tune is heard   
on the distant hill   
for the caged bird   
sings of freedom

the free bird thinks of another breeze
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn
and he names the sky his own

but a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams   
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   
so he opens his throat to sing

the caged bird sings   
with a fearful trill   
of things unknown   
but longed for still   
and his tune is heard   
on the distant hill   
for the caged bird   
sings of freedom
the outlook wasnt brilliant for the mudville nine that day
the score stood four to two with but one inning more to play
and then when cooney died at first and barrows did the same
a sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game

a straggling few got up to go in deep despair the rest
clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast
they thought if only casey could but get a whack at that
wed put up even money now with casey at the bat

but flynn preceded casey as did also jimmy blake
and the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake
so upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat
for there seemed but little chance of caseys getting to the bat

but flynn let drive a single to the wonderment of all
and blake the much despised tore the cover off the ball
and when the dust had lifted and men saw what had occurred
there was jimmy safe at second and flynn a hugging third

then from  throats and more there rose a lusty yell
it rumbled through the valley it rattled in the dell
it knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat
for casey mighty casey was advancing to the bat

there was ease in caseys manner as he stepped into his place
there was pride in caseys bearing and a smile on caseys face
and when responding to the cheers he lightly doffed his hat
no stranger in the crowd could doubt twas casey at the bat

ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt
five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt
then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip
defiance gleamed in caseys eye a sneer curled caseys lip

and now the leather covered sphere came hurtling through the air
and casey stood a watching it in haughty grandeur there
close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped
that aint my style said casey strike one the umpire said

from the benches black with people there went up a muffled roar
like the beating of the storm waves on a stern and distant shore
kill him kill the umpire shouted some one on the stand
and its likely theyd have killed him had not casey raised his hand

with a smile of christian charity great caseys visage shone
he stilled the rising tumult he bade the game go on
he signaled to the pitcher and once more the spheroid flew
but casey still ignored it and the umpire said strike two

fraud cried the maddened thousands and echo answered fraud
but one scornful look from casey and the audience was awed
they saw his face grow stern and cold they saw his muscles strain
and they knew that casey wouldnt let that ball go by again

the sneer is gone from caseys lip his teeth are clinched in hate
he pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate
and now the pitcher holds the ball and now he lets it go
and now the air is shattered by the force of caseys blow

oh somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright
the band is playing somewhere and somewhere hearts are light
and somewhere men are laughing and somewhere children shout
but there is no joy in mudvillemighty casey has struck out
i go to the mountain side
of the house to cut saplings
and clear a view to snow
on the mountain but when i look up
saw in hand i see a nest clutched in
the uppermost branches
i dont cut that one
i dont cut the others either
suddenly in every tree   
an unseen nest
where a mountain   
would be
it is  in new york a friday
three days after bastille day yes
it is  and i go get a shoeshine
because i will get off the  in easthampton   
at  and then go straight to dinner
and i dont know the people who will feed me

i walk up the muggy street beginning to sun   
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy
an ugly new world writing to see what the poets   
in ghana are doing these days
                                                        i go on to the bank
and miss stillwagon first name linda i once heard   
doesnt even look up my balance for once in her life   
and in the golden griffin i get a little verlaine   
for patsy with drawings by bonnard although i do   
think of hesiod trans richmond lattimore or   
brendan behans new play or le balcon or les ngres
of genet but i dont i stick with verlaine
after practically going to sleep with quandariness

and for mike i just stroll into the park lane
liquor store and ask for a bottle of strega and   
then i go back where i came from to th avenue   
and the tobacconist in the ziegfeld theatre and   
casually ask for a carton of gauloises and a carton
of picayunes and a new york post with her face on it

and i am sweating a lot by now and thinking of
leaning on the john door in the  spot
while she whispered a song along the keyboard
to mal waldron and everyone and i stopped breathing
i am a feather on the bright sky
i am the blue horse that runs in the plain
i am the fish that rolls shining in the water
i am the shadow that follows a child
i am the evening light the lustre of meadows
i am an eagle playing with the wind
i am a cluster of bright beads
i am the farthest star
i am the cold of dawn
i am the roaring of the rain
i am the glitter on the crust of the snow
i am the long track of the moon in a lake
i am a flame of four colors
i am a deer standing away in the dusk
i am a field of sumac and the pomme blanche
i am an angle of geese in the winter sky
i am the hunger of a young wolf
i am the whole dream of these things

you see i am alive i am alive
i stand in good relation to the earth
i stand in good relation to the gods
i stand in good relation to all that is beautiful
i stand in good relation to the daughter of tsen tainte
you see i am alive i am alive

life friends is boring we must not say so   
after all the sky flashes the great sea yearns   
we ourselves flash and yearn
and moreover my mother told me as a boy   
repeatingly ever to confess youre bored   
means you have no

inner resources i conclude now i have no   
inner resources because i am heavy bored
peoples bore me
literature bores me especially great literature   
henry bores me with his plights  gripes   
as bad as achilles

who loves people and valiant art which bores me   
and the tranquil hills  gin look like a drag   
and somehow a dog
has taken itself  its tail considerably away
into mountains or sea or sky leaving            
behind me wag
in my younger years
before i learned
black people arent
suppose to dream
i wanted to be
a raelet
and say dr o wn d in my youn tears
or tal kin bout tal kin bout
or marjorie hendricks and grind   
all up against the mic
and scream
baaaaaby nightandday   
baaaaaby nightandday
then as i grew and matured
i became more sensible   
and decided i would   
settle down
and just become
a sweet inspiration
we were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn
a red wing rose in the darkness

and suddenly a hare ran across the road
one of us pointed to it with his hand

that was long ago today neither of them is alive
not the hare nor the man who made the gesture

o my love where are they where are they going
the flash of a hand streak of movement rustle of pebbles
i ask not out of sorrow but in wonder
the river is famous to the fish

the loud voice is famous to silence   
which knew it would inherit the earth   
before anybody said so   

the cat sleeping on the fence is famous to the birds   
watching him from the birdhouse   

the tear is famous briefly to the cheek   

the idea you carry close to your bosom   
is famous to your bosom   

the boot is famous to the earth   
more famous than the dress shoe   
which is famous only to floors

the bent photograph is famous to the one who carries it   
and not at all famous to the one who is pictured   

i want to be famous to shuffling men   
who smile while crossing streets   
sticky children in grocery lines   
famous as the one who smiled back

i want to be famous in the way a pulley is famous   
or a buttonhole not because it did anything spectacular   
but because it never forgot what it could do
talent is what they say
you have after the novel
is published and favorably
reviewed beforehand what
you have is a tedious
delusion a hobby like knitting

work is what you have done
after the play is produced
and the audience claps
before that friends keep asking
when you are planning to go
out and get a job

genius is what they know you
had after the third volume
of remarkable poems earlier
they accuse you of withdrawing
ask why you dont have a baby
call you a bum

the reason people want mfas
take workshops with fancy names
when all you can really
learn is a few techniques
typing instructions and some 
body elses mannerisms

is that every artist lacks
a license to hang on the wall
like your optician your vet
proving you may be a clumsy sadist
whose fillings fall into the stew
but youre certified a dentist

the real writer is one
who really writes talent
is an invention like phlogiston
after the fact of fire
work is its own cure you have to
like it better than being loved
when it is finally ours this freedom this liberty this beautiful
and terrible thing needful to man as air   
usable as earth when it belongs at last to all   
when it is truly instinct brain matter diastole systole   
reflex action when it is finally won when it is more   
than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians   
this man this douglass this former slave this negro   
beaten to his knees exiled visioning a world   
where none is lonely none hunted alien   
this man superb in love and logic this man   
shall be remembered oh not with statues rhetoric   
not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone
but with the lives grown out of his life the lives   
fleshing his dream of the beautiful needful thing
soul and race
are private dominions   
memories and modal
songs a tenor blossoming
which would paint suffering   
a clear color but is not in   
this victorian house
without oil in zero degree
weather and a forty mile an hour wind
it is all a well knit family   
a love supreme
oak leaves pile up on walkway
and steps catholic as apples
in a special mist of clear white   
children who love my children   
i play alabama
on a warped record player
skipping the scratches
on your faces over the fibrous   
conical hairs of plastic
under the wooden floors

dreaming on a train from new york   
to philly you hand out six
notes which become an anthem
to our memories of you
oak birch maple
apple cocoa rubber
for this reason martin is dead
for this reason malcolm is dead
for this reason coltrane is dead
in the eyes of my first son are the browns   
of these men and their music
i too sing america

i am the darker brother
they send me to eat in the kitchen
when company comes
but i laugh
and eat well
and grow strong

tomorrow
ill be at the table
when company comes
nobodyll dare
say to me
eat in the kitchen
then

besides
theyll see how beautiful i am
and be ashamed

if you can keep your head when all about you   
    are losing theirs and blaming it on you   
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
    but make allowance for their doubting too   
if you can wait and not be tired by waiting
    or being lied about dont deal in lies
or being hated dont give way to hating
    and yet dont look too good nor talk too wise

if you can dreamand not make dreams your master   
    if you can thinkand not make thoughts your aim   
if you can meet with triumph and disaster
    and treat those two impostors just the same   
if you can bear to hear the truth youve spoken
    twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
or watch the things you gave your life to broken
    and stoop and build em up with worn out tools

if you can make one heap of all your winnings
    and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss
and lose and start again at your beginnings
    and never breathe a word about your loss
if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    to serve your turn long after they are gone   
and so hold on when there is nothing in you
    except the will which says to them hold on

if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue   
    or walk with kingsnor lose the common touch
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you
    if all men count with you but none too much
if you can fill the unforgiving minute
    with sixty seconds worth of distance run   
yours is the earth and everything thats in it   
    andwhich is moreyoull be a man my son

if mama
could see
she would see   
lucy sprawling   
limbs of lucy
decorating the
backs of chairs
lucy hair
holding the mirrors up   
that reflect odd   
aspects of lucy

if mama
could hear
she would hear
lucysong rolled in the
corners like lint
exotic webs of lucysighs
long lucy spiders explaining   
to obscure gods

if mama
could talk
she would talk
good girl   
good girl   
good girl
clean up your room
because it has no pure products

because the pacific ocean sweeps along the coastline
because the water of the ocean is cold
and because land is better than ocean

because i say we rather than they

because i live in california
i have eaten fresh artichokes
and jacaranda bloom in april and may

because my senses have caught up with my body
my breath with the air it swallows
my hunger with my mouth

because i walk barefoot in my house

because i have nursed my son at my breast
because he is a strong american boy
because i have seen his eyes redden when he is asked who he is
because he answers i dont know

because to have a son is to have a country
because my son will bury me here
because countries are in our blood and we bleed them

because it is late and too late to change my mind
because it is time

her grandmother called her from the playground   
       yes maam
       i want chu to learn how to make rolls said the old   
woman proudly
but the little girl didnt want
to learn how because she knew
even if she couldnt say it that
that would mean when the old one died she would be less   
dependent on her spirit so
she said
       i dont want to know how to make no rolls
with her lips poked out
and the old woman wiped her hands on
her apron saying lord
       these children
and neither of them ever
said what they meant
and i guess nobody ever does
in chicago it is snowing softly
and a man has just done his wash for the week   
he steps into the twilight of early evening   
carrying a wrinkled shopping bag   
full of neatly folded clothes
and for a moment enjoys
the feel of warm laundry and crinkled paper
flannellike against his gloveless hands   
theres a rembrandt glow on his face
a triangle of orange in the hollow of his cheek   
as a last flash of sunset
blazes the storefronts and lit windows of the street

he is asian thai or vietnamese
and very skinny dressed as one of the poor   
in rumpled suit pants and a plaid mackinaw   
dingy and too large
he negotiates the slick of ice
on the sidewalk by his car
opens the fairlanes back door
leans to place the laundry in
and turns for an instant
toward the flurry of footsteps
and cries of pedestrians
as a boythats all he was
backs from the corner package store
shooting a pistol firing it
once at the dumbfounded man
who falls forward
grabbing at his chest

a few sounds escape from his mouth   
a babbling no one understands
as people surround him
bewildered at his speech
the noises he makes are nothing to them   
the boy has gone lost
in the light array of foot traffic
dappling the snow with fresh prints
tonight i read about descartes
grand courage to doubt everything
except his own miraculous existence
and i feel so distinct
from the wounded man lying on the concrete   
i am ashamed

let the night sky cover him as he dies
let the weaver girl cross the bridge of heaven   
and take up his cold hands
lift every voice and sing   
till earth and heaven ring
ring with the harmonies of liberty
let our rejoicing rise
high as the listening skies
let it resound loud as the rolling sea
sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us
sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us   
facing the rising sun of our new day begun
let us march on till victory is won

stony the road we trod
bitter the chastening rod
felt in the days when hope unborn had died   
yet with a steady beat
have not our weary feet
come to the place for which our fathers sighed
we have come over a way that with tears has been watered
we have come treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered
out from the gloomy past   
till now we stand at last
where the white gleam of our bright star is cast

god of our weary years   
god of our silent tears
thou who hast brought us thus far on the way
thou who hast by thy might   
led us into the light
keep us forever in the path we pray
lest our feet stray from the places our god where we met thee
lest our hearts drunk with the wine of the world we forget thee
shadowed beneath thy hand   
may we forever stand   
true to our god
true to our native land

the whiskey on your breath   
could make a small boy dizzy   
but i hung on like death   
such waltzing was not easy

we romped until the pans   
slid from the kitchen shelf   
my mothers countenance   
could not unfrown itself

the hand that held my wrist   
was battered on one knuckle   
at every step you missed
my right ear scraped a buckle

you beat time on my head   
with a palm caked hard by dirt   
then waltzed me off to bed   
still clinging to your shirt

children when was
napoleon bonaparte born
asks teacher

a thousand years ago the children say
a hundred years ago the children say
last year the children say
no one knows

children what did
napoleon bonaparte do
asks teacher

won a war the children say
lost a war the children say
no one knows

our butcher had a dog
called napoleon
says frantisek
the butcher used to beat him and the dog died
of hunger
a year ago

and all the children are now sorry
for napoleon

a narrow fellow in the grass
occasionally rides  
you may have met him did you not
his notice instant is  

the grass divides as with a comb
a spotted shaft is seen
and then it closes at your feet
and opens further on  

he likes a boggy acre    
a floor too cool for corn  
but when a boy and barefoot
i more than once at noon

have passed i thought a whip lash
unbraiding in the sun
when stooping to secure it
it wrinkled and was gone  

several of natures people
i know and they know me
i feel for them a transport
of cordiality

but never met this fellow
attended or alone
without a tighter breathing
and zero at the bone

childhood remembrances are always a drag   
if youre black
you always remember things like living in woodlawn   
with no inside toilet
and if you become famous or something
they never talk about how happy you were to have   
your mother
all to yourself and
how good the water felt when you got your bath   
from one of those
big tubs that folk in chicago barbecue in   
and somehow when you talk about home   
it never gets across how much you
understood their feelings
as the whole family attended meetings about hollydale
and even though you remember
your biographers never understand
your fathers pain as he sells his stock   
and another dream goes
and though youre poor it isnt poverty that
concerns you
and though they fought a lot
it isnt your fathers drinking that makes any difference   
but only that everybody is together and you
and your sister have happy birthdays and very good   
christmases
and i really hope no white person ever has cause   
to write about me
because they never understand
black love is black wealth and theyll
probably talk about my hard childhood
and never understand that
all the while i was quite happy

i met a traveller from an antique land
who saidtwo vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert    near them on the sand
half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown
and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things
the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed
and on the pedestal these words appear
my name is ozymandias king of kings
look on my works ye mighty and despair
nothing beside remains round the decay
of that colossal wreck boundless and bare
the lone and level sands stretch far away
pretty women wonder where my secret lies
im not cute or built to suit a fashion models size   
but when i start to tell them
they think im telling lies
i say
its in the reach of my arms
the span of my hips   
the stride of my step   
the curl of my lips   
im a woman
phenomenally
phenomenal woman   
thats me

i walk into a room
just as cool as you please   
and to a man
the fellows stand or
fall down on their knees   
then they swarm around me
a hive of honey bees   
i say
its the fire in my eyes   
and the flash of my teeth   
the swing in my waist   
and the joy in my feet   
im a woman
phenomenally

phenomenal woman
thats me

men themselves have wondered   
what they see in me
they try so much
but they cant touch
my inner mystery
when i try to show them   
they say they still cant see   
i say
its in the arch of my back   
the sun of my smile
the ride of my breasts
the grace of my style
im a woman
phenomenally
phenomenal woman
thats me

now you understand
just why my heads not bowed   
i dont shout or jump about
or have to talk real loud   
when you see me passing
it ought to make you proud
i say
its in the click of my heels   
the bend of my hair   
the palm of my hand   
the need for my care   
cause im a woman
phenomenally
phenomenal woman
thats me

i am told by many of you that i must forgive and so i shall   
after an indian woman puts her shoulder to the grand coulee dam   
and topples it i am told by many of you that i must forgive   
and so i shall after the floodwaters burst each successive dam   
downriver from the grand coulee i am told by many of you   
that i must forgive and so i shall after the floodwaters find   
their way to the mouth of the columbia river as it enters the pacific   
and causes all of it to rise i am told by many of you that i must forgive   
and so i shall after the first drop of floodwater is swallowed by that salmon   
waiting in the pacific i am told by many of you that i must forgive and so i shall   
after that salmon swims upstream through the mouth of the columbia   
and then past the flooded cities broken dams and abandoned reactors   
of hanford i am told by many of you that i must forgive and so i shall   
after that salmon swims through the mouth of the spokane river   
as it meets the columbia then upstream until it arrives   
in the shallows of a secret bay on the reservation where i wait alone   
i am told by many of you that i must forgive and so i shall after   
that salmon leaps into the night air above the water throws   
a lightning bolt at the brush near my feet and starts the fire   
which will lead all of the lost indians home i am told   
by many of you that i must forgive and so i shall   
after we indians have gathered around the fire with that salmon   
who has three stories it must tell before sunrise one story will teach us   
how to pray another story will make us laugh for hours   
the third story will give us reason to dance i am told by many   
of you that i must forgive and so i shall when i am dancing   
with my tribe during the powwow at the end of the world

once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
    while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door
            only this and nothing more

    ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
    eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow
    from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
            nameless here for evermore

    and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
    so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating
    tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
            this it is and nothing more

    presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore
    but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping
    and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door
that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door
            darkness there and nothing more

    deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing
doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
