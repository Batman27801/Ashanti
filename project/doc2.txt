all your foes are friends and all your days are nights
and all the roads lead round and are not roads at all
and the soul is muscle bound the world a wooden ball
the modern monist too castrates negates our lives
and nothing that we do make or become survives
his terror of confusion freezes the flowing stream
into mere illusion his craving for supreme
completeness means be chokes each orifice with tight
plaster as he evokes a dead ideal of white
all white universal refusing to allow
division or dispersaleternity is now
and now is therefore numb a fact he does not see
postulating a dumb static identity
of essence and existence which could not fuse without
banishing to a distance belief along with doubt
action along with error growth along with gaps
if man is a mere mirror of god the gods collapse
no the formula fails that fails to make it clear
that only change prevails that the seasons make the year
that a thing a beast a man is what it is because
it is something that began and is not what it was
yet is itself throughout fluttering and unfurled
not to be cancelled out not to be merged in world
its entity a denial of all that is not it
its every move a trial through chaos and the pit
an absolute and so defiant of the one
absolute the row of noughts where time is done
where nothing goes or comes and is is one with ought
and all the possible sums alike resolve to nought
world is not like that world is full of blind
gulfs across the flat jags against the mind
swollen or diminished according to the dice
foaming never finished never the same twice
you talk of ultimate value universal form
visions let me tell you that ride upon the storm
and must be made and sought but cannot be maintained
lost as soon as caught always to be regained
mainspring of our striving towards perfection yet
would not be worth achieving if the world were set
fair if error and choice did not exist if dumb
world should find its voice for good and god become
incarnate once for all no perfection means
something but must fall unless there intervenes
between that meaning and the matter it should fill
times revolving hand that never can be still
which being so and life a ferment you and i
can only live by strife in that the living die
and if we use the word eternal stake a claim
only to what a bird can find within the frame
of momentary flight the value will persist
but as event the night sweeps it away in mist
man is man because he might have been a beast
and is not what he was and feels himself increased
man is man in as much as he is not god and yet
hankers to see and touch the pantheon and forget
the means within the end and man is truly man
in that he would transcend and flout the human span
a species become rich by seeing things as wrong
and patching them to which i am proud that i belong
man is surely mad with discontent he is hurled
by lovely hopes or bad dreams against the world
raising a frail scaffold in never ending flux
stubbornly when baffled fumbling the stubborn crux
and so he must continue raiding the abyss
with aching bone and sinew conscious of things amiss
conscious of guilt and vast inadequacy and the sick
ego and the broken past and the clock that goes too quick
conscious of waste of labour conscious of spite and hate
of dissension with his neighbour of beggars at the gate
but conscious also of love and the joy of things and the power
of going beyond and above the limits of the lagging hour
conscious of sunlight conscious of deaths inveigling touch
not completely conscious but partlyand that is much

the room was suddenly rich and the great bay window was
spawning snow and pink roses against it
soundlessly collateral and incompatible
world is suddener than we fancy it

world is crazier and more of it than we think
incorrigibly plural i peel and portion
a tangerine and spit the pips and feel
the drunkenness of things being various

and the fire flames with a bubbling sound for world
is more spiteful and gay than one supposes 
on the tongue on the eyes on the ears in the palms of ones hands
there is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses
and when they bombed other peoples houses we
 
protested
but not enough we opposed them but not
 
enough i was
in my bed around my bed america
 
was falling invisible house by invisible house by invisible house
 
i took a chair outside and watched the sun
 
in the sixth month
of a disastrous reign in the house of money
 
in the street of money in the city of money in the country of money
our great country of money we forgive us
 
lived happily during the war
some say
im now almost
extinct in this park

but the people
who say this
dont know

that by smelling
the orchids
in the trees

theyre sensing
the fragrance
of my chops

that by hearing
the rumbling
of the waterfalls

theyre listening
to my ancestors
great roar

that by observing
the constellations
of the night sky

theyre gazing
at the star spots
on my fur

that i am and
always will be
the wild

untamed
living spirit
of this jungle
words
are birds
that arrive
with books
and spring

they
love
clouds
the wind
and trees

some words
are messengers
that come
from far away
from distant lands

for them
there are
no borders
only stars
moon and sun

some words
are familiar
like canaries
others are exotic
like the quetzal bird

some can stand
the cold
others migrate
with the sun
to the south

some words
die
caged
theyre difficult
to translate

and others
build nests
have chicks
warm them
feed them

teach them
how to fly
and one day
they go away
in flocks

the letters
on this page
are the prints
they leave
by the sea
if black history month is not
viable then wind does not
carry the seeds and drop them
on fertile ground
rain does not
dampen the land
and encourage the seeds
to root
sun does not
warm the earth
and kiss the seedlings
and tell them plain
youre as good as anybody else
youve got a place here too
this is for the pullman porters who organized when people said
they couldnt and carried the pittsburgh courier and the chicago
defender to the black americans in the south so they would
know they were not alone this is for the pullman porters who
helped thurgood marshall go south and come back north to fight
the fight that resulted in brown v board of education because
even though kansas is west and even though topeka is the birth 
place of gwendolyn brooks who wrote the powerful the
chicago defender sends a man to little rock it was the
pullman porters who whispered to the traveling men both
the blues men and the race men so that they both would
know what was going on this is for the pullman porters who
smiled as if they were happy and laughed like they were tickled
when some folks were around and who silently rejoiced in 
when the supreme court announced its  decision that sepa 
rate is inherently unequal this is for the pullman porters who
smiled and welcomed a fourteen year old boy onto their train in
 they noticed his slight limp that he tried to disguise with a
doo wop walk they noticed his stutter and probably understood
why his mother wanted him out of chicago during the summer
when school was out fourteen year old black boys with limps
and stutters are apt to try to prove themselves in dangerous ways
when mothers arent around to look after them so this is for the
pullman porters who looked over that fourteen year old while
the train rolled the reverse of the blues highway from chicago to
st louis to memphis to mississippi this is for the men who kept
him safe and if emmett till had been able to stay on a train all
summer he would have maybe grown a bit of a paunch certainly
lost his hair probably have worn bifocals and bounced his grand 
children on his knee telling them about his summer riding the
rails but he had to get off the train and ended up in money
mississippi and was horribly brutally inexcusably and unac 
ceptably murdered this is for the pullman porters who when the
sheriff was trying to get the body secretly buried got emmetts
body on the northbound train got his body home to chicago
where his mother said i want the world to see what they did
to my boy and this is for all the mothers who cried and this is
for all the people who said never again and this is about rosa
parks whose feet were not so tired it had been after all an ordi 
nary day until the bus driver gave her the opportunity to make
history this is about mrs rosa parks from tuskegee alabama
who was also the field secretary of the naacp this is about the
moment rosa parks shouldered her cross put her worldly goods
aside was willing to sacrifice her life so that that young man in
money mississippi who had been so well protected by the
pullman porters would not have died in vain when mrs parks
said no a passionate movement was begun no longer would
there be a reliance on the law there was a higher law when mrs
parks brought that light of hers to expose the evil of the system
the sun came and rested on her shoulders bringing the heat and
the light of truth others would follow mrs parks four young
men in greensboro north carolina would also say no great
voices would be raised singing the praises of god and exhorting
us to forgive those who trespass against us but it was the
pullman porters who safely got emmett to his granduncle and it
was mrs rosa parks who could not stand that death and in not
being able to stand it she sat back down
it is appropriate that i sing
the song of the feet
 
the weight of the body
and what the body chooses to bear
fall on me
 
i trampled the american wilderness
forged frontier trails
outran the mob in tulsa
got caught in philadelphia
 
and am still unreparated
 
i soldiered on in korea
jungled through vietnam sweated out desert storm
caved my way through afghanistan
tunneled the world trade center
 
and on the worst day of my life
walked behind jfk
shouldered mlk
stood embracing sister betty
 
i wiggle my toes
in the sands of time
trusting the touch that controls my motion
basking in the warmth of the embrace
days end offers with warm salty water
 
it is appropriate i sing
the praise of the feet
 
i am a black woman
i take my kaleidoscope off the shelf
look through the little hole at the end
of the cardboard tube

i turn       and turn       and turn       and turn

letting the crystals shift into strange
and beautiful patterns letting the pieces fall
wherever they will
divide
the year
into seasons
four
subtract
the snow then
add
some more
green
a bud
a breeze
a whispering
behind
the trees
and here
beneath the
rain scrubbed
sky
orange poppies
multiply

i remember
the first day
how i looked down
hoping you wouldnt see
me
and when i glanced up
i saw your smile
shining like a soft light
from deep inside you

im listening you encourage us
come on
join our conversation
let us hear your neon certainties
thorny doubts tangled angers
but for weeks i hid inside

i read and reread your notes
praising
my writing
and you whispered
we need you
and your stories
and questions
that like a fresh path
will take us to new vistas

slowly your faith grew
into my courage
and for you
instead of handing you
a note or apple or flowers
i raised my hand

i carry your smile
and faith inside like i carry
my dogs face
my sisters laugh
creamy melodies
the softness of sunrise
steady blessings of stars
autumn smell of gingerbread
the security of a sweater on a chilly day
when my aunt died
my uncle raised his hands
like a prophet in the bible
ive lost my girl he said
ive lost my girl over and over
shaking his head

i didnt know what to say
where to look
my quiet uncle raising his voice
to silence

my aunt was eighty seven
listen my uncle said sighing
like a tree alone at night
women know
every midnight on new years eve
when others sang
and laughed and hugged
your aunt looked at me
tears in her eyes
sixty years
she knew
one day wed kiss good bye
i sang my songs so much
that they became
the soundtrack for my dreams
the melody of my moods
a room i lived in
and a balm for my wounds
 
i sang my songs enough
to know them backward
and forward enough
to wonder if they could lift me
from hometown haunts
to center stage
 
id sung my songs enough
to think i could take on
baltimores best talent
at the harlem theatre
amateur hour
and maybe even win
 
if you sing a song enough
it can go to your head that way
carole robertston
who loved books earned straight as
and took dance lessons every saturday
who joined the girl scouts and science club
and played clarinet in the high school band
a member of jack and jill of america
carole who thought she might want
to teach history someday
or at least make her mark on it
we practiced together
sweat and stained
we pummeled each other
and laughed off pain
teams may disagree
may tease
may blame
teams may bicker and whine
but get down for the game

you had my back
we fought the fight
and though our score
was less last night
were walking tall
our team came through
and stuck together like crazy glue
im proud to say
i lost with you
arachis hypogaea may have been
smuggled to north america by slaves
who hid seeds of survival in their hair
despite your nakedness the chains the stench
if white men did not eat you you might come
to a cruel land where tended by moonlight
and exhaustion your seed might grow to be
your childrens manna in the wilderness

arachis hypogaea or goober
an annual preferring warmth and sun
is an attractive plant resembling clover
it bears flowers of two distinct genders
the staminate or male yellow pretty
and the inconspicuous pistillate female
when fertilized the pistillate turns down 
and corkscrews six inches into the ground

each corkscrew called a peg grows one to four
peanuts in the soil near the mother plant
each shell two of her shots at infinity
from the laboratory of a slave emerged
a varied balanced diet for the poor
stock foods ink paints cosmetics medicines 
promise and purpose the ancestors dream
the peanut man we say and laugh at him
in his careful welter of dried leaves and seeds
soil samples quartz pebbles notes to myself letters
on dr carvers bedside table
next to his pocket watch
folded in aunt mariahs bible
