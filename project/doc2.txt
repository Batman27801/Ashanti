for two stillborn daughters
buried out there with the carvers child

this new incandescent light makes
his evenings reading unwaveringly easy
if he remembers to wipe his spectacles
he turns to the blossoming story
of abrahams dumbstruck luck
of isaacs pure trust in his fathers wisdom
seven hundred dollars for all of her future
he shakes his head
hybridization cross breeding evolution
he takes to new theories
like a puppy takes to ice cream
we whisper that our green thumb boy
is the black mendel that darwin
would have made good use of carvers eyes
so clear his gift for observation
the best collector ive ever known
i think we have an entirely new species
of pseudocercospora
and always in his threadbare lapel
a flower even in january
ive never asked how

we had doubts
about giving him a class to teach
but hes done a bang up job
with the greenhouse his students
see the light of genius
through the dusky window of his skin
just yesterday that new boy
whats his name from arkansas
tried to raise a ruckus when carver
put his dinner tray down
he cleared his throat stared rattled
his own tray scraped his chair legs
in a rush to move away carver
ate on in silence then the boys
at the table the new boy had moved to
cleared their throats rattled their trays
and scraped their chair legs as they got up
and moved to carvers table

something about the
man does that raises the best
in you ive never asked what
i guess ill put his name next to mine
on that article im sending out
imagine a child at your door
offering to do your wash
clean your house cook
to weed your kitchen garden
or paint you a bunch of flowers
in exchange for a meal
a spindly ten year old alone
and a stranger in town here to go
to our school for colored children
his high peep brought tears
sleeping in a barn and all that
nary mama nor kin
but only white folks
he left with their blessing
his earthly belongings
in a handkerchief tied to a stick

ive brought a houseful of children
into this world concentrating on
that needles eye into eternity
but aint none of them children mine
well of course i moved him on in
he helped me with my washings
brought me roots from the woods
that bleached them white folks sheets
brighter than sunshine he could fill
a canning jar with leaves and petals
so when you lifted the lid
a fine perfume flooded your senses
white bodices and pantalettes danced
around george on my line

he was sweet with the neighbor children
taught the girls to crochet
showed the boys
a seed he said held a worm
cupped hands warmed so it wriggled and set
the seed to twitching
gave them skills and wonders
knelt with me at bedtime

he was the child the good lord gave 
and took away before i got more
than the twinkle of a glimpse
at the man he was going to be
it happened one saturday afternoon
george was holding a black eyed susan
talking about how the seed
this flower grew from
carried a message from a flower
that bloomed a million years ago
and how this flower
would send the message on
to a flower that was going to bloom
in a million more years
praise jesus ill never forget it

he left to find a teach that knew
more than he knew
i give him my bible
i keep his letters
in the bureau tied with a bow
he always sends a dried flower
at first youll joy to see the playful snow
  like white moths trembling on the tropic air
or waters of the hills that softly flow
  gracefully falling down a shining stair
 
and when the fields and streets are covered white
  and the wind worried void is chilly raw
or underneath a spell of heat and light
  the cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw
 
like me youll long for home where birds glad song
  means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry
and tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong
  beneath a vivid silver flecked blue sky
 
but oh more than the changeless southern isles
  when spring has shed upon the earth her charm
youll love the northland wreathed in golden smiles
  by the miraculous sun turned glad and warm
on sundays the preacher gives everyone a chance
to repent their sins miss edna makes me go

to church she wears a bright hat
i wear my suit babies dress in lace

girls my age some pretty some not so
pretty old ladies and men nodding

miss edna every now and then throwing her hand
in the air saying yes lord and preach

i sneak a pen from my back pocket
bend down low like i dropped something

the chorus marches up behind the preacher
clapping and humming and getting ready to sing

i write the word hope on my hand
last night this commercial came on tv it was this white lady making a nice dinner for her husband she made him some baked chicken with potatoes and gravy and some kind of greensnot collards but they still looked real good everything looked so delicious i just wanted to reach into that television and snatch a plate for myself
he gave her a kiss and then a voice came on saying hell love you for it and then the commercial went off

i sat on miss ednas scratchy couch wondering if that man and woman really ate that food or just threw it all away

now ms marcus wants to know why i wrote that the lady is white and i say because its true and ms marcus says lonnie what does race have to do with it forgetting that she asked us to use lots of details when we wrote forgetting that whole long talk she gave yesterday about the importance of description i dont say anything back to her just look down at my arm its dark brown and theres a scab by my wrist that i dont pick at if i remember not to i look at my knuckles theyre real dark too

outside its starting to rain and the way the rain comes downtap tapping against the windowgets me to thinking ms marcus dont understand some things even though shes my favorite teacher in the world things like my brown brown arm and the white lady and man with all that good food to throw away how if you turn on your tv thats what you seepeople with lots and lots of stuff not having to sit on scratchy couches in miss ednas house and the true fact is alotta those people are white maybe its that if youre white you cant see all the whiteness around you
the monsters that come at night dont
breathe fire have two heads or long claws

the monsters that come at night dont
come bloody and half dead and calling your name

they come looking like regular boys
going through your drawers and pockets saying

you better not tell counselor else ill beat you down
the monsters that come at night snatch

the covers off your bed take your
pillow and in the morning

steal your bacon when the cooks back is turned
call themselves the throwaway boys say

you one of us now
when the relatives stop coming

when you dont know where your sister is anymore
when every sign around you says

group home rules dont
do this and dont do that

until it sinks in one rainy saturday afternoon
while youre sitting at the group home window

reading a beat up group home book
wearing a group home hand me down shirt

hearing all the group home loudness that
you are a throwaway boy

and the news just sits in your stomach
hard and heavy as group home food

ms marcus says that an occasional poem is a poem
written about something
important
or special
thats gonna happen
or already did
think of a specific occasion she saysand write about it

like what lamont asks
hes all slouched down in his seat
i dont feel like writing about no occasion

how about your birthday ms marcus says
what about it just a birthday comes in june and it aint
june lamont says as a matter of fact
he says its january and its snowing
then his voice gets real low and he says
and when its january and all cold like this
feels like junes a long long ways away

the whole class looks at ms marcus
some of the kids are nodding
outside the sky looks like its made out of metal
and the cold cold air is rattling the windowpanes
and coming underneath them too

i seen lamonts coat
its gray and the sleeves are too short
its down but it looks like a lot of the feathers fell out
a long time ago
ms marcus got a nice coat
its down too but real puffy so
maybe when shes inside it
she cant even tell january from june

then write about january ms marcus says thats
an occasion
but she looks a little bit sad when she says it
like shes sorry she ever brought the whole
occasional poem thing up

i was gonna write about mamas funeral
but lamont and ms marcus going back and forth
zapped all the ideas from my head

i guess them arguing
on a tuesday in januarys an occasion
so i guess this is an occasional poem
when people ask how i say
a fire took them
and then they look at me like
im the most pitiful thing in the world
so sometimes i just shrug and say
they just died thats all

a fire took their bodies
thats all

i can still feel their voices and hugs and laughing
sometimes
sometimes i can hear my daddy
calling my name
lonnie sometimes
and sometimes locomotion
come on over here a minute
i want to show you something

and then i see his big hands
holding something out to me

it used to be the four of us
at night we went to sleep
in the morning we woke up and ate breakfast
daddy worked for con edison
you ever saw him
climbing out of a manhole
yellow tape keeping the cars from coming
down the block
an orange sign that said men working
i still got his hat its light blue
with con edison in white letters

mama was a receptionist
when you called the office where she worked
she answered the phone like this
graftman paper products how may i help you
it was her work voice
and when you said something like
ma its me
her voice went back to normal to our mamas voice
hey sugar you behaving is the door locked

that stupid fire couldnt take all of them
nothing could do that

nothing
when the kids in my class ask why
i am not allowed to pledge to the flag
i tell them its against my religion but dont say
i am in the world but not of the world this
they would not understand
even though my mothers not a jehovahs witness
she makes us follow their rules and
leave the classroom when the pledge is being said

every morning i walk out with gina and alina
the two other witnesses in my class
sometimes gina says
maybe we should pray for the kids inside
who dont know that god said
no other idols before me that our god
is a jealous god
gina is a true believer her bible open
during reading time but alina and i walk through
our roles as witnesses as though this is the part
weve been given in a play
and once offstage we run free sing
america the beautiful and the star spangled banner
far away from our familiesknowing every word

alina and i want
more than anything to walk back into our classroom
press our hands against our hearts say
i pledge allegiance    loud
without our jealous god looking down on us
     without our parents finding out
without our mothers voices
in our heads saying you are different
chosen
good

when the pledge is over we walk single file
back into the classroom take our separate seats
alina and i far away from gina but gina
always looks back at usas if to say
im watching you as if to say
i know
no one was faster
than my father on the football field
no one could keep him
from crossing the line then
touching down again
coaches were watching the way he moved
his easy stride his long arms reaching
up snatching the ball from its soft pockets
of air

my father dreamed football dreams
and woke up to a scholarship
at ohio state university
grown now
living the big city life
in columbus
just sixty miles
from nelsonville
and from there
interstate  could get you
on your way west to chicago
interstate  could take you south
but my father said
no colored buckeye in his right mind
would ever want to go there

from columbus my father said
you could go just about
anywhere

my mother has a gap between
her two front teeth so does daddy gunnar
each child in this family has the same space
connecting us

our baby brother roman was born pale as dust
his soft brown curls and eyelashes stop
people on the street
whose angel child is this they want to know
when i say my brother the people
wear doubt
thick as a cape
until we smile
and the cape falls
good enough name for me my father said
the day i was born
dont see why
she cant have it too

but the women said no
my mother first
then each aunt pulling my pink blanket back
patting the crop of thick curls
tugging at my new toes
touching my cheeks

we wont have a girl named jack my mother said

and my fathers sisters whispered
a boy named jack was bad enough
but only so my mother could hear
name a girl jack my father said
and she cant help but
grow up strong
raise her right my father said
and shell make that name her own
name a girl jack
and people will look at her twice my father said

for no good reason but to ask if her parents
were crazy my mother said

and back and forth it went until i was jackie
and my father left the hospital mad

my mother said to my aunts
hand me that pen wrote
jacqueline where it asked for a name
jacqueline just in case
someone thought to drop the ie

jacqueline  just in case
i grew up and wanted something a little bit longer
and further away from
jack
my mother says

when mama tried to teach me

to make collards and potato salad
i didnt want to learn

she opens the box of pancake mix adds milk
and eggs stirs i watch
grateful for the food we have nowsyrup waiting
in the cabinet bananas to slice on top
its saturday morning
five days a week she leaves us
to work at an office back in brownsville
saturday we have her to ourselves all day long

me and kay didnt want to be inside cooking

she stirs the lumps from the batter pours it
into the buttered hissing pan

wanted to be with our friends
running wild through greenville
there was a man with a peach tree down the road
one day robert climbed over that fence filled a bucket
with peaches wouldnt share them with any of us but
told us where the peach tree was and thats where we
wanted to be
sneaking peaches from that mans tree throwing
the rotten ones
at your uncles

mama wanted us to learn to cook

ask the boys we said and mama knew that wasnt fair
girls inside and the boys going off to steal peaches
so she let all of us
stay outside until suppertime

and by then she says putting our breakfast on the table

it was too late
the first time i write my full name

jacqueline amanda woodson

without anybodys help
on a clean white page in my composition notebook
     i know

if i wanted to

i could write anything

letters becoming words words gathering meaning
     becoming
thoughts outside my head

becoming sentences

the first time my brother says aint my mother
pulls a branch from the willow tree growing down
the hill at the edge
of our backyard
as she slips her closed hand over it
removes the leaves
my brother begins to cry
because the branch is a switch now

no longer beautifully weeping at the bottom of the hill
it whirs as my mother whips it
through the air and down
against my brothers legs

you will never my mother says
say aint in this house
you will never
say aint anywhere

each switching is a warning to us
our words are to remain
crisp and clear
we are never to say huh
aint or yall
git or gonna
never maamjust yes with eyes
meeting eyes enough
to show respect
dont ever maam anyone
the word too painful
a memory for my mother
of not so long ago
southern subservient days   

the list of what not to say
goes on and on   

you are from the north our mother says
you know the right way to speak

as the switch raises dark welts on my brothers legs
dell and i look on
afraid to open our mouths fearing the south
will slip out or
into them
even though the laws have changed
my grandmother still takes us
to the back of the bus when we go downtown
in the rain its easier my grandmother says
than having white folks look at me like im dirt

but we arent dirt we are people
paying the same fare as other people
when i say this to my grandmother 
she nods says easier to stay where you belong

i look around and see the ones
who walk straight to the back see
the ones who take a seat up front daring
anyone to make them move and know
this is who i want to be not scared
like that brave
like that

still my grandmother takes my hand downtown
pulls me right past the restaurants that have to let us sit
wherever we want now no need in making trouble
she says you all go back to new york city but
i have to live here

we walk straight past woolworths
without even looking in the windows
because the one time my grandmother went inside
they made her wait and wait acted like
i wasnt even there its hard not to see the moment
my grandmother in her sunday clothes a hat
with a flower pinned to it
neatly on her head her patent leather purse
perfectly clasped
between her gloved handswaiting quietly
long past her turn
now when i walk around at lunchtime
i have only two charms in my pocket
an old roman coin mike kanemitsu gave me
and a bolt head that broke off a packing case
when i was in madrid the others never
brought me too much luck though they did
help keep me in new york against coercion
but now im happy for a time and interested

i walk through the luminous humidity
passing the house of seagram with its wet
and its loungers and the construction to
the left that closed the sidewalk if
i ever get to be a construction worker
id like to have a silver hat please
and get to moriartys where i wait for
leroi and hear who wants to be a mover and
shaker the last five years my batting average
is  thats that and leroi comes in
and tells me miles davis was clubbed 
times last night outside birdland by a cop
a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible
disease but we dont give her one we
dont like terrible diseases then

we go eat some fish and some ale its
cool but crowded we dont like lionel trilling
we decide we like don allen we dont like
henry james so much we like herman melville
we dont want to be in the poets walk in
san francisco even we just want to be rich
and walk on girders in our silver hats
i wonder if one person out of the  is
thinking of me as i shake hands with leroi
and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go
back to work happy at the thought possibly so
i know that i shall meet my fate
somewhere among the clouds above
those that i fight i do not hate
those that i guard i do not love
my country is kiltartan cross
my countrymen kiltartans poor
no likely end could bring them loss
or leave them happier than before
nor law nor duty bade me fight
nor public men nor cheering crowds
a lonely impulse of delight
drove to this tumult in the clouds
i balanced all brought all to mind
the years to come seemed waste of breath
a waste of breath the years behind
in balance with this life this death
praise the restless beds
praise the beds that do not adjust
     that wont lift the head to feed
     or lower for shots
     or blood
     or raise to watch the tinny tv
praise the hotel tv that wont quit
      its murmur  holler
praise the room service
      that doesnt exist
      just the slow delivery to the front desk
      of cooling pizzas
       brown bags leaky
      greasy  clear
praise the vending machines
praise the change
praise the hot water
 the heat
       or the loud cool
       that helps the helpless sleep

praise the front desk
       who knows to wake
       rm  when the hospital rings
praise the silent phone
praise the dark drawn
       by thick daytime curtains
       after long nights of waiting
       awake

praise the waiting  then praise the nothing
       thats better than bad news
praise the wakeup call
       at  am
praise the sleeping in
praise the card hung on the door
       like a whisper
       lips pressed silent
praise the strangers hands
       that change the sweat of sheets
praise the checking out

praise the going home
       to beds unmade
       for days
beds that wont resurrect
       or rise
that lie there like a child should
        sleeping tubeless

praise this mess
         that can be left
wake to find everything black
what was white all the vice
versawhite maids on tv black

sitcoms that star white dwarfs
cute as pearl buttons black presidents
black houses white horse

candidates all bleach burns
clothes black drive roads
white as you are white songs

on the radio stolen by black bands
like secret pancake recipes white back up
singers ball players  boxers all

white as tar feathers on chickens
dark as everything boiling in the pot
that called the kettle honky even

whites of the eye turn dark pupils
clear  changing as a cats
is this what weve wanted

 waited for to see snow
covering everything black
as christmas dark pages written

white upon all our eclipses bright
dark stars shooting across pale
sky glowing like ash in fire shower

every skin only money keeps
green still grows  burns like grass
under dark daylight

how much delight before we collapse
how much earth in the lungs
how much wine

when we want more
when the weeds sprawl
it is not what you think

think how fast some landscapes change
the lover the gardeners grand idea
the failing maple

the boat about to capsize
the correction
the hands reflection

the impossible replication of weight
versus time
how it will never mean what you want
late august given heavy rain and sun
for a full week the blackberries would ripen
at first just one a glossy purple clot
among others red green hard as a knot
you ate that first one and its flesh was sweet
like thickened wine summers blood was in it
leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for
picking then red ones inked up and that hunger
sent us out with milk cans pea tins jam pots
where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots
round hayfields cornfields and potato drills
we trekked and picked until the cans were full
until the tinkling bottom had been covered
with green ones and on top big dark blobs burned
like a plate of eyes our hands were peppered
with thorn pricks our palms sticky as bluebeards

we hoarded the fresh berries in the byre
but when the bath was filled we found a fur
a rat grey fungus glutting on our cache
the juice was stinking too once off the bush
the fruit fermented the sweet flesh would turn sour
i always felt like crying it wasnt fair
that all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot
each year i hoped theyd keep knew they would not
try to praise the mutilated world
remember junes long days
and wild strawberries drops of ros wine
the nettles that methodically overgrow
the abandoned homesteads of exiles
you must praise the mutilated world
you watched the stylish yachts and ships
one of them had a long trip ahead of it
while salty oblivion awaited others
youve seen the refugees going nowhere
youve heard the executioners sing joyfully
you should praise the mutilated world
remember the moments when we were together
in a white room and the curtain fluttered
return in thought to the concert where music flared
you gathered acorns in the park in autumn
and leaves eddied over the earths scars
praise the mutilated world
and the gray feather a thrush lost
and the gentle light that strays and vanishes
and returns
this night nurse is different
she walks into my room and does not turn the light on
she thinks i am sleeping
i have just barely opened my left eye
am looking through the slightest slit
as moonlight exposes the room
for what it really isa collection
of surfaces lines and planes mostly
the night nurse puts a foot up on the radiator
and braces her clipboard on her knee
as she appears to take down a few notes
i imagine she is working on a sonnet
and that her ankle looks like polished walnut
you imagine she is working on a crossword
and that her feet are killing her
the slightest slit is like an old gate
at a japanese tea garden at night
in the rain that is supposed to be closed
that is supposed to be locked
someone has locked up poorly youd say
incorrectly but no one has asked you
there are birds here
so many birds here
is what i was trying to say
when they said those birds were metaphors
for what is trapped
between buildings
and buildings no
the birds are here
to root around for bread
the girls hands tear
and toss like confetti no
i dont mean the bread is torn like cotton
i said confetti and no
not the confetti
a tank can make of a building
i mean the confetti
a boy cant stop smiling about
and no his smile isnt much
like a skeleton at all and no
his neighborhood is not like a war zone
i am trying to say
his neighborhood
is as tattered and feathered
as anything else
as shadow pierced by sun
and light parted
by shadow dance as anything else
but they wont stop saying
how lovely the ruins
how ruined the lovely
children must be in that birdless city
a bird came down the walk   
he did not know i saw  
he bit an angle worm in halves
and ate the fellow raw 
 
and then he drank a dew
from a convenient grass  
and then hopped sidewise to the wall
to let a beetle pass  
 
he glanced with rapid eyes
that hurried all abroad  
they looked like frightened beads i thought
he stirred his velvet head   
 
like one in danger cautious
i offered him a crumb
and he unrolled his feathers 
and rowed him softer home  
 
than oars divide the ocean
too silver for a seam
or butterflies off banks of noon
leap plashless as they swim 
my song has put off her adornments
she has no pride of dress and decoration
ornaments would mar our union
they would come between thee and me
their jingling would drown thy whispers
 
my poets vanity dies in shame before thy sight
o master poet i have sat down at thy feet
only let me make my life simple and straight
like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music
when you were building the i  bypass
one of your dozers moving earth
at the center of a great pit
slipped its thick blade beneath
the water table slicing into the earths
wet palm and the silt moistened
beneath the huge things tires and the crew
was sent home for the day
next morning water filled the pit
nothing anyone could do to stop it coming
it was a revelation kidney shaped deep
green there between the interstate
and the sewage treatment plant
when nothing else worked you called it
a lake and opened it to the public
and we were the public
my mother sends me a black and white
photograph of her and my father circa
 posing with two indian men

who are those indian guys i ask her
on the phone

i dont know she says

the next obvious question then why
did you send me this photo but i dont
ask it

one of those strange indian men is
pointing up toward the sky

above them a bird shaped like a
question mark

this is a world where there are monsters
there are monsters everywhere racoons and skunks
there are possums outside there are monsters in my bed
there is one monster he is my little one
i talk to my little monster
i give my little monster some bacon but that does not satisfy him
i tell him ssh ssh dont growl little monster
and he growls oh boy does he growl
and he wants something from me
he wants my soul
and finally giving in i give him my gleaming soul
and as he eats my gleaming soul i am one with him
and stare out his eyepits and i see nothing but white
and then i see nothing but fog and the white i had seen before was nothing but fog
and there is nothing but fog out the eyes of monsters
superman flies onto his first comic book

mister johnson
i thank you for your soul
jook joints about to come alive
its like a bee outside a hive
and when the hive begins to hum
its like a dim and distant drum
and when the drum begins to beat
its like a circus down the street
and when the street begins to fill
its like a sudden summer chill
and just as summer simmers down
its like the fireworks over town
dont matter what the preachers say
this congregations here to stay
cause when the jook joint comes alive
is when the delta blues arrive
lady could pour you a song
coffee and a little cream
stir it the whole night long
into a brown sugar dream

lady could wrap you a note
up in a velvet night
sometimes manhattan satin
always harlem delight

lady day could sing it
like nobody ever has
at the shim sham club hot cha cha
joints that swung on jazz

her bittersweet songs told heartbreak
meet your sister pain
but lady melted yesterdays
into beautiful rain
pour o pour that parting soul in song
o pour it in the sawdust glow of night
into the velvet pine smoke air tonight
and let the valley carry it along
and let the valley carry it along

o land and soil red soil and sweet gum tree
so scant of grass so profligate of pines
now just before an epochs sun declines
thy son in time i have returned to thee
