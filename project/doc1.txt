stay i said
to the cut flowers
they bowed
their heads lower
stay i said to the spider
who fled
stay leaf
it reddened
embarrassed for me and itself
stay i said to my body
it sat as a dog does
obedient for a moment
soon starting to tremble
stay to the earth
of riverine valley meadows
of fossiled escarpments
of limestone and sandstone
it looked back
with a changing expression in silence
stay i said to my loves
each answered
always
two sets
of family stories
one long and detailed
about many centuries
of island ancestors all living
on the same tropical farm
the other side of the family tells stories
that are brief and vague about violence
in the ukraine which dads parents
had to flee forever leaving all their
loved ones
behind
they dont even know if anyone
survived
when mami tells her flowery tales of cuba
she fills the twining words with relatives
but when i ask my
ukrainian jewish american grandma
about her childhood in a village
near snowy kiev
all she reveals is a single
memory
of ice skating
on a frozen pond
apparently the length
of a grown ups
growing up story
is determined
by the difference
between immigration
and escape
newsmen call it the cuban missile crisis
teachers say its the end of the world
at school they instruct us to look up
and watch the cuban cursed sky
search for a streak of light
listen for a piercing shriek
the whistle that will warn us
as poisonous a bombs
zoom close
hide under a desk
pretend that furniture is enough
to protect us against perilous flames
radiation contamination toxic breath
each air raid drill is sheer terror
but some of the city kids giggle
they dont believe that death
is real
theyve never touched a bullet
or seen a vulture or made music
by shaking
the jawbone
of a mule
when i hide under my frail school desk
my heart grows as rough and brittle
as the slab of wood
that fails to protect me
from realitys
gloom
mad has decided to catch a vulture
the biggest bird she can find
she is so determined and so inventive
that by stringing together a rickety trap
of ropes and sticks she creates
a puzzling structure that just might
be clever enough to trick a buzzard
once the traps baited with leftover pork
from supper
 
mad and i used to do everything together
but now i need a project all my own
so i roam the green fields
finding bones
 
the skull of a wild boar
the jawbone of a mule
 
older cousins show me
how to shake the mules quijada
to make the blunt teeth
rattle
 
guitars
drums
gourds
sticks
 
a cow bell
a washboard
pretty soon we have
a whole orchestra
 
on cuban farms even death
can turn into
music

the first story i ever write
is a bright crayon picture
of a dancing tree the branches
tossed by island wind

i draw myself standing beside the tree
with a colorful parrot soaring above me
and a magical turtle clasped in my hand
and two yellow wings fluttering
on the proud shoulders of my ruffled
cuban rumba dancers
fancy dress

in my california kindergarten class
the teacher scolds me real trees
dont look like that

its the moment
when i first
begin to learn
that teachers
can be wrong

they have never seen
the dancing plants
of cuba

i came to panama planning to dig
the eighth wonder of the world
but i was told that white men
should never be seen working
with shovels so i took a police job
and now ive been transferred
to the census

i roam the jungle counting laborers
who live in shanties and those who live
on the run fugitives who are too angry
to keep working for silver in a system
where they know that others
earn gold

when islanders see me coming
theyre afraid of trouble even though
i cant arrest them anymorenow
all i need is a record of their names ages
homelands and colors

the rules of this census confound me
im expected to count white jamaicans
as dark and every shade of spaniard
as semi white so that americans
can pretend
theres only one color
in each country

how am i supposed to enumerate
this kid with the cuban accent
his skin is medium but his eyes
are green

and what about that puerto rican
scientist who speaks like a new york
professor
or the girl who says she doesnt know
where she was born or who her parents
areshe could be part native or part french
jamaican chinese 

she could even be part american
from people who passed through here
way back
in gold rush days

counting feels just as impossible
as turning solid mountains
into a ditch
on an island of music
in a city of drumbeats
the drum dream girl
dreamed
 
of pounding tall conga drums
tapping small bong drums
and boom boom booming
with long loud sticks
on big round silvery
moon bright timbales
 
but everyone
on the island of music
in the city of drumbeats
believed that only boys
should play drums
 
so the drum dream girl
had to keep dreaming
quiet
secret
drumbeat
dreams
 
at outdoor cafs that looked like gardens
she heard drums played by men
but when she closed her eyes
she could also hear
her own imaginary
music
 
when she walked under
wind wavy palm trees
in a flower bright park
she heard the whir of parrot wings
the clack of woodpecker beaks
the dancing tap
of her own footsteps
and the comforting pat
of her own
heartbeat
 
at carnivals she listened
to the rattling beat
of towering
dancers
on stilts
 
and the dragon clang
of costumed drummers
wearing huge masks
 
at home her fingertips
rolled out their own
dreamy drum rhythm
on tables and chairs
 
and even though everyone
kept reminding her that girls
on the island of music
have never played drums
 
the brave drum dream girl
dared to play
tall conga drums
small bong drums
and big round silvery
moon bright timbales
 
her hands seemed to fly
as they rippled
rapped
and pounded
all the rhythms
of her drum dreams
 
her big sisters were so excited
that they invited her to join
their new all girl dance band
 
but their father said only boys
should play drums
 
so the drum dream girl
had to keep dreaming
and drumming
alone
 
until finally
her father offered
to find a music teacher
who could decide if her drums
deserved
to be heard
 
the drum dream girls
teacher was amazed
the girl knew so much
but he taught her more
and more
and more
 
and she practiced
and she practiced
and she practiced
 
until the teacher agreed
that she was ready
to play her small bong drums
outdoors at a starlit caf
that looked like a garden
 
where everyone who heard
her dream bright music
sang
and danced
and decided
that girls should always
be allowed to play
drums
 
and both girls and boys
should feel free
to dream

jamaican digging crews have to sleep
eighty men to a room in huge warehouses
like the ones where big wooden crates
of dynamite are stored

my hands feel like scorpion claws
clamped on to a hard hard shovel all day
then curled into fists at night

at dawn the steaming labor trains
deliver us by the thousands down into
that snake pit where we dig
until my muscles feel
as weak as water
and my backbone
is like shattered glass

but only half the day
is over

at lunchtime we see sunburned
american engineers and foremen
eating at tables in shady tents
with the flaps left open
so that we have to watch
how they sit on nice chairs
looking restful

we also watch the medium dark
spanish men relaxing as they sit
on their train tracks grinning
as if they know secrets

we have no place to sit not even
a stool so we stand plates in hand
uncomfortable
and undignified

back home i used to dream of saving
enough panama money
to buy a bit of good farmland
for momma and my little brothers
and sisters so that we would all
have plenty to eat

now all i want is a chair
and food with some spice
and fair treatment
justice

books are door shaped
portals
carrying me
across oceans
and centuries
helping me feel
less alone

but my mother believes
that girls who read too much
are unladylike
and ugly
so my fathers books are locked
in a clear glass cabinet i gaze
at enticing covers
and mysterious titles
but i am rarely permitted
to touch
the enchantment
of words

poems
stories
plays
all are forbidden
girls are not supposed to think
but as soon as my eager mind
begins to race free thoughts
rush in
to replace
the trapped ones

i imagine distant times
and faraway places
ghosts
vampires
ancient warriors
fantasy moves into
the tangled maze
of lonely confusion

secretly i open
an invisible book in my mind
and i step
through its magical door shape
into a universe
of dangerous villains
and breathtaking heroes

many of the heroes are men
and boys but some are girls
so tall
strong
and clever
that they rescue other children
from monsters

city life is a whirl of poetry readings
and forbidden tertulias gatherings
where young and old rich and poor
male and female dark and light
runaway slaves and freed ones
former masters and former
servantsall take turns
sharing secret verses
rooted in startling
new ideas

each evening i go home
with a mind that glows
in the light of words
which leap
like flames

time was away and somewhere else
there were two glasses and two chairs
and two people with the one pulse
somebody stopped the moving stairs
time was away and somewhere else

and they were neither up nor down
the streams music did not stop
flowing through heather limpid brown
although they sat in a coffee shop
and they were neither up nor down

the bell was silent in the air
holding its inverted poise
between the clang and clang a flower
a brazen calyx of no noise
the bell was silent in the air

the camels crossed the miles of sand
that stretched around the cups and plates
the desert was their own they planned
to portion out the stars and dates
the camels crossed the miles of sand

time was away and somewhere else
the waiter did not come the clock
forgot them and the radio waltz
came out like water from a rock
time was away and somewhere else

her fingers flicked away the ash
that bloomed again in tropic trees
not caring if the markets crash
when they had forests such as these
her fingers flicked away the ash

god or whatever means the good
be praised that time can stop like this
that what the heart has understood
can verify in the bodys peace
god or whatever means the good

time was away and she was here
and life no longer what it was
the bell was silent in the air
and all the room one glow because
time was away and she was here

it is patent to the eye that cannot face the sun
the smug philosophers lie who say the world is one
world is other and other world is here and there
parmenides would smother life for lack of air
precluding birth and death his crystal never breaks
no movement and no breath no progress nor mistakes
nothing begins or ends no one loves or fights
