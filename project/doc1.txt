stay i said
to the cut flowers
they bowed
their heads lower
stay i said to the spider
who fled
stay leaf
it reddened
embarrassed for me and itself
stay i said to my body
it sat as a dog does
obedient for a moment
soon starting to tremble
stay to the earth
of riverine valley meadows
of fossiled escarpments
of limestone and sandstone
it looked back
with a changing expression in silence
stay i said to my loves
each answered
always
two sets
of family stories
one long and detailed
about many centuries
of island ancestors all living
on the same tropical farm
the other side of the family tells stories
that are brief and vague about violence
in the ukraine which dads parents
had to flee forever leaving all their
loved ones
behind
they dont even know if anyone
survived
when mami tells her flowery tales of cuba
she fills the twining words with relatives
but when i ask my
ukrainian jewish american grandma
about her childhood in a village
near snowy kiev
all she reveals is a single
memory
of ice skating
on a frozen pond
apparently the length
of a grown ups
growing up story
is determined
by the difference
between immigration
and escape
newsmen call it the cuban missile crisis
teachers say its the end of the world
at school they instruct us to look up
and watch the cuban cursed sky
search for a streak of light
listen for a piercing shriek
the whistle that will warn us
as poisonous a bombs
zoom close
hide under a desk
pretend that furniture is enough
to protect us against perilous flames
radiation contamination toxic breath
each air raid drill is sheer terror
but some of the city kids giggle
they dont believe that death
is real
theyve never touched a bullet
or seen a vulture or made music
by shaking
the jawbone
of a mule
when i hide under my frail school desk
my heart grows as rough and brittle
as the slab of wood
that fails to protect me
from realitys
gloom
mad has decided to catch a vulture
the biggest bird she can find
she is so determined and so inventive
that by stringing together a rickety trap
of ropes and sticks she creates
a puzzling structure that just might
be clever enough to trick a buzzard
once the traps baited with leftover pork
from supper
 
mad and i used to do everything together
but now i need a project all my own
so i roam the green fields
finding bones
 
the skull of a wild boar
the jawbone of a mule
 
older cousins show me
how to shake the mules quijada
to make the blunt teeth
rattle
 
guitars
drums
gourds
sticks
 
a cow bell
a washboard
pretty soon we have
a whole orchestra
 
on cuban farms even death
can turn into
music

the first story i ever write
is a bright crayon picture
of a dancing tree the branches
tossed by island wind

i draw myself standing beside the tree
with a colorful parrot soaring above me
and a magical turtle clasped in my hand
and two yellow wings fluttering
on the proud shoulders of my ruffled
cuban rumba dancers
fancy dress

in my california kindergarten class
the teacher scolds me real trees
dont look like that

its the moment
when i first
begin to learn
that teachers
can be wrong

they have never seen
the dancing plants
of cuba

i came to panama planning to dig
the eighth wonder of the world
but i was told that white men
should never be seen working
with shovels so i took a police job
and now ive been transferred
to the census

i roam the jungle counting laborers
who live in shanties and those who live
on the run fugitives who are too angry
to keep working for silver in a system
where they know that others
earn gold

when islanders see me coming
theyre afraid of trouble even though
i cant arrest them anymorenow
all i need is a record of their names ages
homelands and colors

the rules of this census confound me
im expected to count white jamaicans
as dark and every shade of spaniard
as semi white so that americans
can pretend
theres only one color
in each country

how am i supposed to enumerate
this kid with the cuban accent
his skin is medium but his eyes
are green

and what about that puerto rican
scientist who speaks like a new york
professor
or the girl who says she doesnt know
where she was born or who her parents
areshe could be part native or part french
jamaican chinese 

she could even be part american
from people who passed through here
way back
in gold rush days

counting feels just as impossible
as turning solid mountains
into a ditch
on an island of music
in a city of drumbeats
the drum dream girl
dreamed
 
of pounding tall conga drums
tapping small bong drums
and boom boom booming
with long loud sticks
on big round silvery
moon bright timbales
 
but everyone
on the island of music
in the city of drumbeats
believed that only boys
should play drums
 
so the drum dream girl
had to keep dreaming
quiet
secret
drumbeat
dreams
 
at outdoor cafs that looked like gardens
she heard drums played by men
but when she closed her eyes
she could also hear
her own imaginary
music
 
when she walked under
wind wavy palm trees
in a flower bright park
she heard the whir of parrot wings
the clack of woodpecker beaks
the dancing tap
of her own footsteps
and the comforting pat
of her own
heartbeat
 
at carnivals she listened
to the rattling beat
of towering
dancers
on stilts
 
and the dragon clang
of costumed drummers
wearing huge masks
 
at home her fingertips
rolled out their own
dreamy drum rhythm
on tables and chairs
 
and even though everyone
kept reminding her that girls
on the island of music
have never played drums
 
the brave drum dream girl
dared to play
tall conga drums
small bong drums
and big round silvery
moon bright timbales
 
her hands seemed to fly
as they rippled
rapped
and pounded
all the rhythms
of her drum dreams
 
her big sisters were so excited
that they invited her to join
their new all girl dance band
 
but their father said only boys
should play drums
 
so the drum dream girl
had to keep dreaming
and drumming
alone
 
until finally
her father offered
to find a music teacher
who could decide if her drums
deserved
to be heard
 
the drum dream girls
teacher was amazed
the girl knew so much
but he taught her more
and more
and more
 
and she practiced
and she practiced
and she practiced
 
until the teacher agreed
that she was ready
to play her small bong drums
outdoors at a starlit caf
that looked like a garden
 
where everyone who heard
her dream bright music
sang
and danced
and decided
that girls should always
be allowed to play
drums
 
and both girls and boys
should feel free
to dream

jamaican digging crews have to sleep
eighty men to a room in huge warehouses
like the ones where big wooden crates
of dynamite are stored

my hands feel like scorpion claws
clamped on to a hard hard shovel all day
then curled into fists at night

at dawn the steaming labor trains
deliver us by the thousands down into
that snake pit where we dig
until my muscles feel
as weak as water
and my backbone
is like shattered glass

but only half the day
is over

at lunchtime we see sunburned
american engineers and foremen
eating at tables in shady tents
with the flaps left open
so that we have to watch
how they sit on nice chairs
looking restful

we also watch the medium dark
spanish men relaxing as they sit
on their train tracks grinning
as if they know secrets

we have no place to sit not even
a stool so we stand plates in hand
uncomfortable
and undignified

back home i used to dream of saving
enough panama money
to buy a bit of good farmland
for momma and my little brothers
and sisters so that we would all
have plenty to eat

now all i want is a chair
and food with some spice
and fair treatment
justice

books are door shaped
portals
carrying me
across oceans
and centuries
helping me feel
less alone

but my mother believes
that girls who read too much
are unladylike
and ugly
so my fathers books are locked
in a clear glass cabinet i gaze
at enticing covers
and mysterious titles
but i am rarely permitted
to touch
the enchantment
of words

poems
stories
plays
all are forbidden
girls are not supposed to think
but as soon as my eager mind
begins to race free thoughts
rush in
to replace
the trapped ones

i imagine distant times
and faraway places
ghosts
vampires
ancient warriors
fantasy moves into
the tangled maze
of lonely confusion

secretly i open
an invisible book in my mind
and i step
through its magical door shape
into a universe
of dangerous villains
and breathtaking heroes

many of the heroes are men
and boys but some are girls
so tall
strong
and clever
that they rescue other children
from monsters

city life is a whirl of poetry readings
and forbidden tertulias gatherings
where young and old rich and poor
male and female dark and light
runaway slaves and freed ones
former masters and former
servantsall take turns
sharing secret verses
rooted in startling
new ideas

each evening i go home
with a mind that glows
in the light of words
which leap
like flames

time was away and somewhere else
there were two glasses and two chairs
and two people with the one pulse
somebody stopped the moving stairs
time was away and somewhere else

and they were neither up nor down
the streams music did not stop
flowing through heather limpid brown
although they sat in a coffee shop
and they were neither up nor down

the bell was silent in the air
holding its inverted poise
between the clang and clang a flower
a brazen calyx of no noise
the bell was silent in the air

the camels crossed the miles of sand
that stretched around the cups and plates
the desert was their own they planned
to portion out the stars and dates
the camels crossed the miles of sand

time was away and somewhere else
the waiter did not come the clock
forgot them and the radio waltz
came out like water from a rock
time was away and somewhere else

her fingers flicked away the ash
that bloomed again in tropic trees
not caring if the markets crash
when they had forests such as these
her fingers flicked away the ash

god or whatever means the good
be praised that time can stop like this
that what the heart has understood
can verify in the bodys peace
god or whatever means the good

time was away and she was here
and life no longer what it was
the bell was silent in the air
and all the room one glow because
time was away and she was here

it is patent to the eye that cannot face the sun
the smug philosophers lie who say the world is one
world is other and other world is here and there
parmenides would smother life for lack of air
precluding birth and death his crystal never breaks
no movement and no breath no progress nor mistakes
nothing begins or ends no one loves or fights
all your foes are friends and all your days are nights
and all the roads lead round and are not roads at all
and the soul is muscle bound the world a wooden ball
the modern monist too castrates negates our lives
and nothing that we do make or become survives
his terror of confusion freezes the flowing stream
into mere illusion his craving for supreme
completeness means be chokes each orifice with tight
plaster as he evokes a dead ideal of white
all white universal refusing to allow
division or dispersaleternity is now
and now is therefore numb a fact he does not see
postulating a dumb static identity
of essence and existence which could not fuse without
banishing to a distance belief along with doubt
action along with error growth along with gaps
if man is a mere mirror of god the gods collapse
no the formula fails that fails to make it clear
that only change prevails that the seasons make the year
that a thing a beast a man is what it is because
it is something that began and is not what it was
yet is itself throughout fluttering and unfurled
not to be cancelled out not to be merged in world
its entity a denial of all that is not it
its every move a trial through chaos and the pit
an absolute and so defiant of the one
absolute the row of noughts where time is done
where nothing goes or comes and is is one with ought
and all the possible sums alike resolve to nought
world is not like that world is full of blind
gulfs across the flat jags against the mind
swollen or diminished according to the dice
foaming never finished never the same twice
you talk of ultimate value universal form
visions let me tell you that ride upon the storm
and must be made and sought but cannot be maintained
lost as soon as caught always to be regained
mainspring of our striving towards perfection yet
would not be worth achieving if the world were set
fair if error and choice did not exist if dumb
world should find its voice for good and god become
incarnate once for all no perfection means
something but must fall unless there intervenes
between that meaning and the matter it should fill
times revolving hand that never can be still
which being so and life a ferment you and i
can only live by strife in that the living die
and if we use the word eternal stake a claim
only to what a bird can find within the frame
of momentary flight the value will persist
but as event the night sweeps it away in mist
man is man because he might have been a beast
and is not what he was and feels himself increased
man is man in as much as he is not god and yet
hankers to see and touch the pantheon and forget
the means within the end and man is truly man
in that he would transcend and flout the human span
a species become rich by seeing things as wrong
and patching them to which i am proud that i belong
man is surely mad with discontent he is hurled
by lovely hopes or bad dreams against the world
raising a frail scaffold in never ending flux
stubbornly when baffled fumbling the stubborn crux
and so he must continue raiding the abyss
with aching bone and sinew conscious of things amiss
conscious of guilt and vast inadequacy and the sick
ego and the broken past and the clock that goes too quick
conscious of waste of labour conscious of spite and hate
of dissension with his neighbour of beggars at the gate
but conscious also of love and the joy of things and the power
of going beyond and above the limits of the lagging hour
conscious of sunlight conscious of deaths inveigling touch
not completely conscious but partlyand that is much

the room was suddenly rich and the great bay window was
spawning snow and pink roses against it
soundlessly collateral and incompatible
world is suddener than we fancy it

world is crazier and more of it than we think
incorrigibly plural i peel and portion
a tangerine and spit the pips and feel
the drunkenness of things being various

and the fire flames with a bubbling sound for world
is more spiteful and gay than one supposes 
on the tongue on the eyes on the ears in the palms of ones hands
there is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses
and when they bombed other peoples houses we
 
protested
but not enough we opposed them but not
 
enough i was
in my bed around my bed america
 
was falling invisible house by invisible house by invisible house
 
i took a chair outside and watched the sun
 
in the sixth month
of a disastrous reign in the house of money
 
in the street of money in the city of money in the country of money
our great country of money we forgive us
 
lived happily during the war
some say
im now almost
extinct in this park

but the people
who say this
dont know

that by smelling
the orchids
in the trees

theyre sensing
the fragrance
of my chops

that by hearing
the rumbling
of the waterfalls

theyre listening
to my ancestors
great roar

that by observing
the constellations
of the night sky

theyre gazing
at the star spots
on my fur

that i am and
always will be
the wild

untamed
living spirit
of this jungle
words
are birds
that arrive
with books
and spring

they
love
clouds
the wind
and trees

some words
are messengers
that come
from far away
from distant lands

for them
there are
no borders
only stars
moon and sun

some words
are familiar
like canaries
others are exotic
like the quetzal bird

some can stand
the cold
others migrate
with the sun
to the south

some words
die
caged
theyre difficult
to translate

and others
build nests
have chicks
warm them
feed them

teach them
how to fly
and one day
they go away
in flocks

the letters
on this page
are the prints
they leave
by the sea
if black history month is not
viable then wind does not
carry the seeds and drop them
on fertile ground
rain does not
dampen the land
and encourage the seeds
to root
sun does not
warm the earth
and kiss the seedlings
and tell them plain
youre as good as anybody else
youve got a place here too
this is for the pullman porters who organized when people said
they couldnt and carried the pittsburgh courier and the chicago
defender to the black americans in the south so they would
know they were not alone this is for the pullman porters who
helped thurgood marshall go south and come back north to fight
the fight that resulted in brown v board of education because
even though kansas is west and even though topeka is the birth 
place of gwendolyn brooks who wrote the powerful the
chicago defender sends a man to little rock it was the
pullman porters who whispered to the traveling men both
the blues men and the race men so that they both would
know what was going on this is for the pullman porters who
smiled as if they were happy and laughed like they were tickled
when some folks were around and who silently rejoiced in 
when the supreme court announced its  decision that sepa 
rate is inherently unequal this is for the pullman porters who
smiled and welcomed a fourteen year old boy onto their train in
 they noticed his slight limp that he tried to disguise with a
doo wop walk they noticed his stutter and probably understood
why his mother wanted him out of chicago during the summer
when school was out fourteen year old black boys with limps
and stutters are apt to try to prove themselves in dangerous ways
when mothers arent around to look after them so this is for the
pullman porters who looked over that fourteen year old while
the train rolled the reverse of the blues highway from chicago to
st louis to memphis to mississippi this is for the men who kept
him safe and if emmett till had been able to stay on a train all
summer he would have maybe grown a bit of a paunch certainly
lost his hair probably have worn bifocals and bounced his grand 
children on his knee telling them about his summer riding the
rails but he had to get off the train and ended up in money
mississippi and was horribly brutally inexcusably and unac 
ceptably murdered this is for the pullman porters who when the
sheriff was trying to get the body secretly buried got emmetts
body on the northbound train got his body home to chicago
where his mother said i want the world to see what they did
to my boy and this is for all the mothers who cried and this is
for all the people who said never again and this is about rosa
parks whose feet were not so tired it had been after all an ordi 
nary day until the bus driver gave her the opportunity to make
history this is about mrs rosa parks from tuskegee alabama
who was also the field secretary of the naacp this is about the
moment rosa parks shouldered her cross put her worldly goods
aside was willing to sacrifice her life so that that young man in
money mississippi who had been so well protected by the
pullman porters would not have died in vain when mrs parks
said no a passionate movement was begun no longer would
there be a reliance on the law there was a higher law when mrs
parks brought that light of hers to expose the evil of the system
the sun came and rested on her shoulders bringing the heat and
the light of truth others would follow mrs parks four young
men in greensboro north carolina would also say no great
voices would be raised singing the praises of god and exhorting
us to forgive those who trespass against us but it was the
pullman porters who safely got emmett to his granduncle and it
was mrs rosa parks who could not stand that death and in not
being able to stand it she sat back down
it is appropriate that i sing
the song of the feet
 
the weight of the body
and what the body chooses to bear
fall on me
 
i trampled the american wilderness
forged frontier trails
outran the mob in tulsa
got caught in philadelphia
 
and am still unreparated
 
i soldiered on in korea
jungled through vietnam sweated out desert storm
caved my way through afghanistan
tunneled the world trade center
 
and on the worst day of my life
walked behind jfk
shouldered mlk
stood embracing sister betty
 
i wiggle my toes
in the sands of time
trusting the touch that controls my motion
basking in the warmth of the embrace
days end offers with warm salty water
 
it is appropriate i sing
the praise of the feet
 
i am a black woman
i take my kaleidoscope off the shelf
look through the little hole at the end
of the cardboard tube

i turn       and turn       and turn       and turn

letting the crystals shift into strange
and beautiful patterns letting the pieces fall
wherever they will
divide
the year
into seasons
four
subtract
the snow then
add
some more
green
a bud
a breeze
a whispering
behind
the trees
and here
beneath the
rain scrubbed
sky
orange poppies
multiply

i remember
the first day
how i looked down
hoping you wouldnt see
me
and when i glanced up
i saw your smile
shining like a soft light
from deep inside you

im listening you encourage us
come on
join our conversation
let us hear your neon certainties
thorny doubts tangled angers
but for weeks i hid inside

i read and reread your notes
praising
my writing
and you whispered
we need you
and your stories
and questions
that like a fresh path
will take us to new vistas

slowly your faith grew
into my courage
and for you
instead of handing you
a note or apple or flowers
i raised my hand

i carry your smile
and faith inside like i carry
my dogs face
my sisters laugh
creamy melodies
the softness of sunrise
steady blessings of stars
autumn smell of gingerbread
the security of a sweater on a chilly day
when my aunt died
my uncle raised his hands
like a prophet in the bible
ive lost my girl he said
ive lost my girl over and over
shaking his head

i didnt know what to say
where to look
my quiet uncle raising his voice
to silence

my aunt was eighty seven
listen my uncle said sighing
like a tree alone at night
women know
every midnight on new years eve
when others sang
and laughed and hugged
your aunt looked at me
tears in her eyes
sixty years
she knew
one day wed kiss good bye
i sang my songs so much
that they became
the soundtrack for my dreams
the melody of my moods
a room i lived in
and a balm for my wounds
 
i sang my songs enough
to know them backward
and forward enough
to wonder if they could lift me
from hometown haunts
to center stage
 
id sung my songs enough
to think i could take on
baltimores best talent
at the harlem theatre
amateur hour
and maybe even win
 
if you sing a song enough
it can go to your head that way

who joined the girl scouts and science club
and played clarinet in the high school band
a member of jack and jill of america
carole who thought she might want
to teach history someday
or at least make her mark on it
we practiced together
sweat and stained
we pummeled each other
and laughed off pain
teams may disagree
may tease
may blame
teams may bicker and whine
but get down for the game

you had my back
we fought the fight
and though our score
was less last night
were walking tall
our team came through
and stuck together like crazy glue
im proud to say
i lost with you
arachis hypogaea may have been
smuggled to north america by slaves
who hid seeds of survival in their hair
despite your nakedness the chains the stench
if white men did not eat you you might come
to a cruel land where tended by moonlight
and exhaustion your seed might grow to be
your childrens manna in the wilderness

arachis hypogaea or goober
an annual preferring warmth and sun
is an attractive plant resembling clover
it bears flowers of two distinct genders
the staminate or male yellow pretty
and the inconspicuous pistillate female
when fertilized the pistillate turns down 
and corkscrews six inches into the ground

each corkscrew called a peg grows one to four
peanuts in the soil near the mother plant
each shell two of her shots at infinity
