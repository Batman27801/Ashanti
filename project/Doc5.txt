thy son i have in time returned to thee

in time for though the sun is setting on
a song lit race of slaves it has not set
though late o soil it is not too late yet
to catch thy plaintive soul leaving soon gone
leaving to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone
o negro slaves dark purple ripened plums
squeezed and bursting in the pine wood air
passing before they stripped the old tree bare
one plum was saved for me one seed becomes

an everlasting song a singing tree
caroling softly souls of slavery
what they were and what they are to me
caroling softly souls of slavery
as a boy i bicycled the block
wa brown mop top falling
into a tail bleached blond

gold like under golden light
like colors of noble knights
banging on corners unconcerned

wthe colors i borea shorty
too small to war with too brown
to be down for the block

white knights became brown
kings still showing black  gold
on corners now crowned

the block a branch branded
wla corona graffitied on
garage doors by the pawns

as a teen i couldve beamed
the crown walked in wout
the beat down custom

warred wmy cousin
who claimed two six
the set on the next block

decked in black  beige
but i preferred games to gangs
books to crooks wearing hats

crooked to the left or right
fighting for a plot a block
to spot  mark wblood

of boys who knew no better
way to grow up than throw up
the crown  be down for whatever
downhill i came hungry and yet not starved
cold yet had heat within me that was proof
against the north wind tired yet so that rest
had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof

then at the inn i had food fire and rest
knowing how hungry cold and tired was i
all of the night was quite barred out except
an owls cry a most melancholy cry

shaken out long and clear upon the hill
no merry note nor cause of merriment
but one telling me plain what i escaped
and others could not that night as in i went

and salted was my food and my repose
salted and sobered too by the birds voice
speaking for all who lay under the stars
soldiers and poor unable to rejoice
my candle burns at both ends
   it will not last the night
but ah my foes and oh my friends
   it gives a lovely light
christmas eve and twelve of the clock
now they are all on their knees
an elder said as we sat in a flock
by the embers in hearthside ease

we pictured the meek mild creatures where
they dwelt in their strawy pen
nor did it occur to one of us there
to doubt they were kneeling then

so fair a fancy few would weave
in these years yet i feel
if someone said on christmas eve
come see the oxen kneel

in the lonely barton by yonder coomb
our childhood used to know
i should go with him in the gloom
hoping it might be so
i am offering this poem to you
since i have nothing else to give
keep it like a warm coat
when winter comes to cover you
or like a pair of thick socks
the cold cannot bite through

                         i love you

i have nothing else to give you
so it is a pot full of yellow corn
to warm your belly in winter
it is a scarf for your head to wear
over your hair to tie up around your face

                         i love you

keep it treasure this as you would
if you were lost needing direction
in the wilderness life becomes when mature
and in the corner of your drawer
tucked away like a cabin or hogan
in dense trees come knocking
and i will answer give you directions
and let you warm yourself by this fire
rest by this fire and make you feel safe

                         i love you

its all i have to give
and all anyone needs to live
and to go on living inside
when the world outside
no longer cares if you live or die
remember

                         i love you
i am four in this photograph standing   
on a wide strip of mississippi beach   
my hands on the flowered hips

of a bright bikini my toes dig in   
curl around wet sand the sun cuts   
the rippling gulf in flashes with each   

tidal rush minnows dart at my feet
glinting like switchblades i am alone
except for my grandmother other side   

of the camera telling me how to pose   
it is  two years after they opened   
the rest of this beach to us   

forty years since the photograph   
where she stood on a narrow plot   
of sand marked colored smiling

her hands on the flowered hips   
of a cotton meal sack dress

closed mondays

is music    is men
off early from work    is waiting
for the chance at the chair
while the eagle claws holes
in your pockets    keeping
time    by the turning
of rusty fans    steel flowers with
cold breezes    is having nothing
better to do    than guess at the years
of hair    matted beneath the soiled caps
of drunks    the pain of running
a fisted comb through stubborn
knots    is the dark dirty low
down blues    the tender heads
of sons fresh from cornrows    all
wonder at losing    half their height
is a mother gathering hair    for good
luck    for a soft wig    is the round
difficulty of ears    the peach
faced boys asking eddie
to cut in parts and arrows
wanting to have their names read
for just a few days    and among thin
jazz    is the quick brush of a done
head    the black flood around
your feet    grandfathers
stopping their games of ivory
dominoes    just before they reach the bone
yard    is winking widowers announcing
cut it clean off    im through courting
and hair only gets in the way    is the final
spin of the chair    a reflection of
a reflection    that sting of wintergreen
tonic    on the neck of a sleeping snow
haired man    when you realize it is
your turn    you are next
when i was a child i knew red miners
dressed raggedly and wearing carbide lamps
i saw them come down red hills to their camps
dyed with red dust from old ishkooda mines
night after night i met them on the roads
or on the streets in town i caught their glance
the swing of dinner buckets in their hands
and grumbling undermining all their words

i also lived in low cotton country
where moonlight hovered over ripe haystacks
or stumps of trees and croppers rotting shacks
with famine terror flood and plague near by
where sentiment and hatred still held sway
and only bitter land was washed away

when i was one and twenty
       i heard a wise man say
give crowns and pounds and guineas
       but not your heart away
give pearls away and rubies
       but keep your fancy free
but i was one and twenty
       no use to talk to me

when i was one and twenty
       i heard him say again
the heart out of the bosom
       was never given in vain
tis paid with sighs a plenty
       and sold for endless rue
and i am two and twenty
       and oh tis true tis true

i feel myself in need
   of the inspiring strains of ancient lore
my heart to lift my empty mind to feed
   and all the world explore

i know that i am old
   and never can recover what is past
but for the future may some light unfold
   and soar from ages blast

i feel resolved to try
   my wish to prove my calling to pursue
or mount up from the earth into the sky
   to show what heaven can do

my genius from a boy
   has fluttered like a bird within my heart
but could not thus confined her powers employ
   impatient to depart

she like a restless bird
   would spread her wing her power to be unfurld
and let her songs be loudly heard
   and dart from world to world
just the place for a snark the bellman cried
   as he landed his crew with care
supporting each man on the top of the tide
   by a finger entwined in his hair

just the place for a snark i have said it twice
   that alone should encourage the crew
just the place for a snark i have said it thrice
   what i tell you three times is true

the crew was complete it included a boots
   a maker of bonnets and hoods
a barrister brought to arrange their disputes
   and a broker to value their goods

a billiard marker whose skill was immense
   might perhaps have won more than his share
but a banker engaged at enormous expense
   had the whole of their cash in his care

there was also a beaver that paced on the deck
   or would sit making lace in the bow
and had often the bellman said saved them from wreck
   though none of the sailors knew how

there was one who was famed for the number of things
   he forgot when he entered the ship
his umbrella his watch all his jewels and rings
   and the clothes he had bought for the trip

he had forty two boxes all carefully packed
   with his name painted clearly on each
but since he omitted to mention the fact
   they were all left behind on the beach

the loss of his clothes hardly mattered because
   he had seven coats on when he came
with three pair of bootsbut the worst of it was
   he had wholly forgotten his name

he would answer to hi or to any loud cry
   such as fry me or fritter my wig
to what you may call um or what was his name
   but especially thing um a jig

while for those who preferred a more forcible word
   he had different names from these
his intimate friends called him candle ends
   and his enemies toasted cheese

his form is ungainlyhis intellect small
   so the bellman would often remark
but his courage is perfect and that after all
   is the thing that one needs with a snark

he would joke with hnas returning their stare
   with an impudent wag of the head
and he once went a walk paw in paw with a bear
   just to keep up its spirits he said

he came as a baker but owned when too late
   and it drove the poor bellman half mad
he could only bake bride cakefor which i may state
   no materials were to be had

the last of the crew needs especial remark
   though he looked an incredible dunce
he had just one ideabut that one being snark
   the good bellman engaged him at once

he came as a butcher but gravely declared
   when the ship had been sailing a week
he could only kill beavers the bellman looked scared
   and was almost too frightened to speak

but at length he explained in a tremulous tone
   there was only one beaver on board
and that was a tame one he had of his own
   whose death would be deeply deplored

the beaver who happened to hear the remark
   protested with tears in its eyes
that not even the rapture of hunting the snark
   could atone for that dismal surprise

it strongly advised that the butcher should be
   conveyed in a separate ship
but the bellman declared that would never agree
   with the plans he had made for the trip

navigation was always a difficult art
   though with only one ship and one bell
and he feared he must really decline for his part
   undertaking another as well

the beavers best course was no doubt to procure
   a second hand dagger proof coat
so the baker advised itand next to insure
   its life in some office of note

this the banker suggested and offered for hire
   on moderate terms or for sale
two excellent policies one against fire
   and one against damage from hail

yet still ever after that sorrowful day
   whenever the butcher was by
the beaver kept looking the opposite way
   and appeared unaccountably shy

                  fit the second
                      the bellmans speech

the bellman himself they all praised to the skies
   such a carriage such ease and such grace
such solemnity too one could see he was wise
   the moment one looked in his face

he had bought a large map representing the sea
   without the least vestige of land
and the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
   a map they could all understand

whats the good of mercators north poles and equators
   tropics zones and meridian lines
so the bellman would cry and the crew would reply
   they are merely conventional signs

other maps are such shapes with their islands and capes
   but weve got our brave captain to thank
so the crew would protest that hes bought us the best
   a perfect and absolute blank

this was charming no doubt but they shortly found out
   that the captain they trusted so well
had only one notion for crossing the ocean
   and that was to tingle his bell

he was thoughtful and gravebut the orders he gave
   were enough to bewilder a crew
when he cried steer to starboard but keep her head larboard
   what on earth was the helmsman to do

then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes
   a thing as the bellman remarked
that frequently happens in tropical climes
   when a vessel is so to speak snarked

but the principal failing occurred in the sailing
   and the bellman perplexed and distressed
said he had hoped at least when the wind blew due east
   that the ship would not travel due west

but the danger was pastthey had landed at last
   with their boxes portmanteaus and bags
yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view
   which consisted to chasms and crags

the bellman perceived that their spirits were low
   and repeated in musical tone
some jokes he had kept for a season of woe
   but the crew would do nothing but groan

he served out some grog with a liberal hand
   and bade them sit down on the beach
and they could not but own that their captain looked grand
   as he stood and delivered his speech

friends romans and countrymen lend me your ears
   they were all of them fond of quotations
so they drank to his health and they gave him three cheers
   while he served out additional rations

we have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks
   four weeks to the month you may mark
but never as yet tis your captain who speaks
   have we caught the least glimpse of a snark

we have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days
   seven days to the week i allow
but a snark on the which we might lovingly gaze
   we have never beheld till now

come listen my men while i tell you again
   the five unmistakable marks
by which you may know wheresoever you go
   the warranted genuine snarks

let us take them in order the first is the taste
   which is meagre and hollow but crisp
like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist
   with a flavour of will o the wisp

its habit of getting up late youll agree
   that it carries too far when i say
that it frequently breakfasts at five oclock tea
   and dines on the following day

the third is its slowness in taking a jest
   should you happen to venture on one
it will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed
   and it always looks grave at a pun

the fourth is its fondness for bathing machines
   which it constantly carries about
and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes
   a sentiment open to doubt

the fifth is ambition it next will be right
   to describe each particular batch
distinguishing those that have feathers and bite
   from those that have whiskers and scratch

for although common snarks do no manner of harm
   yet i feel it my duty to say
some are boojums the bellman broke off in alarm
   for the baker had fainted away

            fit the third
               the bakers tale

they roused him with muffinsthey roused him with ice
   they roused him with mustard and cress
they roused him with jam and judicious advice
   they set him conundrums to guess

when at length he sat up and was able to speak
   his sad story he offered to tell
and the bellman cried silence not even a shriek
   and excitedly tingled his bell

there was silence supreme not a shriek not a scream
   scarcely even a howl or a groan
as the man they called ho told his story of woe
   in an antediluvian tone

my father and mother were honest though poor
   skip all that cried the bellman in haste
if it once becomes dark theres no chance of a snark
   we have hardly a minute to waste

i skip forty years said the baker in tears
   and proceed without further remark
to the day when you took me aboard of your ship
   to help you in hunting the snark
